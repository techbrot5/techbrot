# BUILD-TRACKER.md — living truth (overrides blueprint between revisions)

## ⭐ V2 RECOMPOSE — CURRENT STATUS (updated 2026-06-23 · D1 COMPLETE)
**R0 — DUAL-LOG EVERY TURN (founder, 2026-06-23):** append the full turn to
`_build/reports/SESSION-LOG.md` AND update THIS file (family status) every turn; cat the
tail of both back so the founder sees them current. Never skip either.
**ARCHITECTURE RULE (founder):** spine/common composition lives in the LAYOUT (families
inherit); genuinely bespoke per-page content renders via SHARED dc-system v2 components in
the `{{content}}` slot. NEVER build composition in individual pages; NEVER flatten bespoke
content to force uniformity. Fix shared components at SOURCE → every family inherits.
**BUILD METHOD:** `--incremental` for body/content edits (full build only after token/
dc-system/_data/layout changes or end-of-family); scoped battery+section-bg during iteration,
FULL sitewide battery at per-family commit; batch fixes before rebuilding; keep `--serve` off
during heavy builds (8 GB). FULL-DEPTH equity GREEN per page is non-negotiable + cannot be deferred.

**PHASE:** V2 full-recompose (real handoff components + full depth). Order:
D1 → D3 → D2 → D4/5/6 (NY incl) → D7 → B1-B5 → C1 → E1-E6 → F1 → F2 → G1 → G2 → A1.

| Family | Layout | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| C2 comparison (/vs/, 14) | t-comparison | ✅ REP done | bookkeeper-vs-accountant proof; fan-out pending |
| **D1 money (19)** | **t-money (data-driven spine)** | **✅ 19/19 DONE** | bookkeeping 3 + migration 9 + QB-service 4 + accounting 3, all full-depth GREEN, ledes tightened. proadvisor-near-me flagged for possible re-tier (prose-heavy). |
| **D3 state pillar (5)** | t-state-pillar (data-driven) | **✅ 5/5 DONE** | 16-section handoff; NY full depth intact; taccount figure; light CTA; pillarAnchor fix; full-depth GREEN |
| **D2 prose (153)** | t-prose (v2) | **✅ 153/153 DONE** | help 52 + online 39 + resources 19 + QB sub-pages 31 + accounting 12, all full-depth GREEN. Non-uniform schema anchors preserved; prose-table + IRS-triage handled. 31 still on t-guide = other families (correct) |
| **D4/D6 children (~86)** | t-location (v2) | **✅ 86/86 DONE** | ALL city + industry children true-v2: NY 18 (frozen, divergent anchors) + CA/TX/FL/IL 68 (via 2 shared partials — 0 leaks). Rate-free tax, FAQ de-duped. |
| **D5 NY service landings (12)** | t-money (v2) | **✅ 12/12 DONE** | recomposed to t-money spine, true-v2, NY frozen, depth-gate caught+restored 1 h1. Spine: signals opener-or-title + .lift__tag. Speakable cssSelector repoint deferred to pre-flip. |
| Location sub-hubs (10) | t-location | **✅ DONE** | state city/industry listings → Location-Sub-Hub v2; find-an-accountant silo (children+sub-hubs) complete |
| **D7 triage (10)** | t-triage (v2) | **✅ 10/10 DONE** | all honest-triage on t-triage, Sheet-7 compliant (disclosure above fold verbatim, Intuit-billing qualified away, calm CTA, only verbatim 'official' negations). Depth gate caught+restored 1 h1. |
| **B1-B5 hubs (~20)** | t-hub (v2) | **🔄 foundation + 3 REPs** | t-hub v2 built + accounting/resources/find-an-accountant REPs (clean). FLAGS: subagent committed w/o my gate (passed); accounting silo got DARK CTA (convention=light → founder call). Fan-out ~17 (8 B1 silo + 5 B2 card-grid + 4 B3 listing), clean switch. about=G2, qb/compare=C1 (re-scoped). |
| **C2 fan-out (13)** | t-comparison | **⏳ PENDING** | only the bookkeeper-vs-accountant REP is on t-comparison; 13 /vs/ siblings still old — fan out to the proven REP pattern |
| **C1 / E1-E6 / F1-F2 / G1-G2 / A1** | various | **🔜 NEXT** | comparison hub (+qb/compare) · glossary/frameworks/tool/listing · pricing (incl 5 state) · legal/about-trust · home LAST · pre-flip sitewide pass |
| proadvisor-near-me | t-money | **⏳ review** | flagged for possible re-tier (prose-heavy) — founder call |

**SHARED v2 COMPONENTS (fix at SOURCE → all families inherit):** PARTIALS — trust-strip.njk
(handoff sand band, label-left/badges-right) · proof-strip.njk (4 short default claims, one clean
row, nowrap) · in-brief.njk (ADAPTIVE: short→2-col, long→heading-top flow, no dead column).
dc-system.css — proofbar · dark-dossier AI · deliver / deliver--3 · process-grid (vertical-stack,
heading optional) · ptier (+per) · checklist / incl-card · opquote/opcard · callband · intake ·
final-dark · 2 signature SVGs (recon-beforeafter, cleanup-timeline). Self-contained :root tokens.
NOTE: C2 /vs/ in-brief is a SEPARATE .tldr (single-col), not the shared in-brief partial. Pages on
spine carry redundant site.min.css (trim pre-flip).

## ⭐ PERMANENT STANDING RULES (added 2026-06-15 — apply EVERY session, EVERY stop)
**R1 — REPORT AT EVERY STOP.** Before asking the founder for anything (approval, a
decision, review), write a complete, stand-alone, honest report to
`_build/reports/round-NN.md` containing: (1) WHAT YOU DID — every page/file built or
changed this turn; (2) PREVIEW URLS — exact full `https://techbrot-preview.pages.dev/…`
link for every page touched + a one-line note each (what to check / what changed / the
citable specific added); (3) WHAT YOU THOUGHT / DECISIONS — the reasoning behind every
judgment call, tier assignment, content choice, deviation (so the founder + strategy-Claude
audit the thinking, not just the output); (4) VERIFICATION — per page: equity GREEN, axe,
overflow, tier, design-fidelity gate, CSS bytes vs gate; (5) OPEN ITEMS / next / STOP state.
Flag weaknesses, do not defend. **NO approval request without the report + URLs.**
**R2 — MIGRATION BUILD RULE (content-to-goal, visual-floor).** For the 104 migrations:
CONTENT is built to the GOAL — fully enhanced, rich, deep, citable-specific, correct tier,
conversion seam, honest-triage where it applies, every baseline equity element preserved AND
enriched. Content is PERMANENT (survives the design reset unchanged) so it is worth doing
right now; never thin content to save time. VISUAL EXECUTION is floor — current components
used correctly, design-fidelity gate passes, no 404s, no breakage, but no bespoke
current-design polish (the skin is redone in the reset). Citable specifics must be TRUE and
publicly verifiable; honesty discipline is absolute (no fabricated stats/reviews/prices/dates).
**R3 — MIGRATION DRIFT DISCIPLINE (added 2026-06-15, after round-22 wave-1 drift).** Follow
`_build/reports/MIGRATION-PROTOCOL.md` for every migration agent: (T1) INJECT the frozen equity
contract from `equity_contract.py <url>` into the prompt — agents match exact baseline.json
strings, never re-derive headings/FAQ from the old HTML; (T2) headings are frozen strings (exact
level, no reword/`<br>`/qualifier/reorder); (T3) no collapsing a baseline H2/H3 into hero/CTA/
in-brief/table-cell; (T4) FAQ from the contract verbatim, enrichment append-only; (T5) mandatory
pre-return self-check checklist against the contract; (T6) content-to-goal, visual-floor. **WAVE
CAP ~5 pages** (never a full silo). Central battery gate before every commit is the backstop.
Special-case pages get their OWN review, not batch-approval:
`/quickbooks/speak-to-a-quickbooks-expert/` (Sheet-7 honest-triage), team/credentials pages
(founder-name-zero), and the first `find-an-accountant/` t-location page (new tier).
**R4 — GIT HYGIENE (added 2026-06-15).** Stage explicit paths (`git add <path> …`), never
`git add -A`, so an accidental working-tree deletion can't be auto-staged. (Round-23 a stray
`git add -A` staged 9 report deletions; caught + restored.)
**R7 — AUTONOMOUS WAVE RUN (added 2026-06-15; SCOPE EXTENDED to the WHOLE remaining migration —
NY children now, AND QB-remainder, vs, partners, the 4 CA/TX/FL/IL landings, and accounting (39,
LAST)).** Proceed wave-by-wave (~5 pages) WITHOUT waiting for founder approval
between waves — keep moving; if the founder doesn't respond, continue with the best recommended
choice. Each wave: full MIGRATION-PROTOCOL (contract injection, content-to-goal/visual-floor, full
battery + probes before commit, equity GREEN REQUIRED to ship). Log every decision/judgment call
(tier, honesty reframe wording per R5, local-content choices, deviations) in the round report + here.
Report per R1 with URLs after EACH wave (no stop for sign-off). **TWO HARD STOPS — do NOT auto-proceed,
beep + wait:** (1) a page the battery/contract fails on that can't be cleanly fixed to equity-GREEN
(never ship degraded or guess); (2) a genuinely-unclear honesty/no-fabrication judgment R5 doesn't
already cover (never guess on honesty). Otherwise run the full 38 NY children continuously.
**R6 — BEEP AT EVERY STOP (added 2026-06-15, founder preference).** Whenever the turn STOPS for
founder input/review, the LAST action must play an audible alert so the founder knows it's
waiting: `powershell [console]::beep(1000,500)` (fallback `[System.Media.SystemSounds]::Asterisk.Play()`).
**R5 — LOCATION ILLUSTRATIVE-NOT-FABRICATED (added 2026-06-15, standing for EVERY state/location
page).** Illustrative/representative scenarios are fine WHEN LABELED as such ("a representative
cleanup engagement," "the kind of situation we handle"). NEVER assert a specific real client
engagement, or "real engagement outcomes," the firm can't substantiate. Same discipline as #4
research-log N=0 and the 2-real-reviews-only limit — no fabricated specifics anywhere. (NY-pillar
ruling: the 4 "Recent New York results" figures, formerly "real engagement outcomes, anonymized by
client request," are reframed to explicitly representative/illustrative; operational substance —
patterns, problems, work — kept. Reviews on any page = only the 2 real Clutch reviews.)

## ⭐ STANDING RULE R9 — PAGE-COUNT LINE EVERY ROUND REPORT (founder 2026-06-17)
Every round report (every turn) MUST carry a COUNT line alongside the URLs, exact format:
`COUNT: total pages live = X · re-skinned (142) + growth this phase = Y · pages added THIS turn = [list new URLs] · remaining in current cluster = Z · next cluster = ___`
So the founder always sees: what was done this turn (every new URL), the running total, and what's left.

## 🌱 GROWTH PHASE (founder greenlit 2026-06-17 — flip held; build to ~200 first, then flip)
**Discipline = same as re-skin, HONESTY LOUDER (new content):** REAL claims only — no fabricated stats/reviews/
counts/case-studies/testimonials/credentials; founder-name-zero; real Intuit badge only; never imply Intuit
affiliation; if a claim can't be substantiated, write without it or flag (honesty is the #1 growth gate).
Every page: top-0.01% AI-citable (speakable/QAPage/FAQ, schema-rich, entity-clear) · Google-rank-engineered ·
CALL conversion · elevated design system · built-to-standard not floor. Gates fire (variety/honesty/forms/CLS/
axe/overflow/equity-not-applicable-but-quality). **NEW types need a PROOF first (founder glance) before fan-out.**
STOP-AND-WAIT on: (1) build-ORDER (below — awaiting confirm), (2) each new-type proof, (3) honesty-unsure, (4)
ambiguous v4 cluster structure.

**▶ PROPOSED BUILD ORDER (awaiting founder confirm — ranked by north-star value):**
1. **Glossary (~46)** — NEW type · highest AI-citation-per-effort (definitions = LLM quote magnets) · fast · low
   honesty risk · internal-link authority into money pages. **Recommended FIRST PROOF.**
2. **State children — CA→TX→FL→IL (~120–150)** — existing proven NY template · biggest CALLS engine (local "[city]
   bookkeeper" intent) · completes the namesake silo. Needs a CA content-QUALITY proof (real local tax, not mad-lib).
3. **Support/Help silo (~67)** — t-bofu + honest-triage + error-pattern · problem-aware → calls · heavily AI-cited.
4. **More QuickBooks (~86)** — core-brand cluster dominance (product/help/error on existing types).
5. **Tools/calculators (~10)** — NEW type · engagement + link-magnet + hand-off to file-review (calls).
6. **Guides (~16, 3 go-remote-blocker first)** — t-guide · citations + mid-funnel.
7. **Pricing children (5, BOFU) + Blog (10, NEW article type)**.
8. **Trust/Reviews/Partners/Legal/Careers children + Case studies** — supporting; **HONESTY-GATED:** reviews =
   only 2 real Clutch (no AggregateRating until 5+; /reviews/ currently 301→/trust/); case studies = REAL only
   (likely BLOCKED unless the firm has substantiable engagements — FLAG). Build the substantiable ones, skip/flag rest.
**NEW-TYPE proofs required:** glossary · tools/calculator · blog-article · case-study · reviews-listing · switch.
**Existing types (content-quality check only):** state children · QB-more · support · guides · pricing children.

## ⭐ STANDING UX RULE (founder 2026-06-17 — R8) — COMPONENT/TOKEN LEVEL, ONE SOURCE, SITE-WIDE
**Every UX fix lands at the COMPONENT/TOKEN level in base CSS, ONE source, site-wide — never page-by-page.**
Best/futuristic/logical UX, every fix serving the north star (top-0.01% AI citations + Google rank + calls +
dominate every cluster) as #1 priority. Examples in place: the LINK-TYPE underline system (action/contact =
partial→full; nav/list = clean→hover) + animated `.lnk-arrow` — all defined once in `09-extensions.css` /
`04-chrome.css` and inherited by every page. WCAG: nav links with no resting underline keep a visible focus
state (axe stays green). When a new UX need appears, add/extend the component rule — do not hand-edit pages.

## ⭐ CANONICAL DOC SYSTEM (founder, 2026-06-15 · v5 added 2026-06-20 — LOCKED standing file structure)
ONE file per role, no overlap, **update-don't-spawn**. These are the only authoritative docs:
0. **techbrot-blueprint-v5.xlsx** (repo root, NEW 2026-06-20) — **STRATEGIC truth**: current state (586 =
   393 core + 193 location), all URLs, locations, the design METHOD (kitchen-sink), the post-flip FORWARD
   PLAN, rules + flip gate. Supersedes v4/v3.xlsx and the ARCHITECTURE-TRUTH body where they differ.
   BUILD-TRACKER (this file) stays the live EXECUTION truth and wins on operational conflict.
1. **BUILD-TRACKER.md** — OPERATIONAL truth (status, resume anchor, governing rules). **Read first.**
2. **ARCHITECTURE-TRUTH.md** (was `TECHBROT-BLUEPRINT-V5.md`, renamed 2026-06-15; **reconciled to v5.xlsx
   2026-06-20** — top banner carries the conflict-delta table) — ARCHITECTURE truth (URLs, families, state
   strategy). NOTE the name clash: the *.md* was once called "v5"; the current "v5" is the *.xlsx* (item 0).
3. **Re-architecture authority** — `_build/reports/SECTION-SIGNATURE-MAP.md` (25 families) +
   `DESIGN-CONTRACT.md` (FREE/FROZEN) + `KITCHEN-SINK-SPEC.md`; the LIVE visual system is the Claude Design
   project "TechBrot Design System Elevation". *(Replaces the now-archived PAGE-TYPE-REGISTRY / REDESIGN-BRIEF /
   PREMIUM-UPGRADE-PLAN — the new design supersedes them.)*
4. **_build/baseline/baseline.json + _build/battery/equity-exceptions.json** — FROZEN machine contract (not hand-edited).
5. **_build/reports/SESSION-LOG.md** — ROLLING per-turn log (standing rule 2026-06-20; append newest at bottom;
   the single file the founder uploads to the strategy chat). Milestone `round-NN.md` reports continue in addition.
**Archived 2026-06-20 → `/_archive/` (git-tracked, REVERSIBLE; superseded, NOT authoritative):** PAGE-TYPE-REGISTRY.md ·
REDESIGN-BRIEF.md · PREMIUM-UPGRADE-PLAN.md · FINAL-MIGRATION-REPORT.md · MIGRATION-PROTOCOL.md · RESKIN-HANDOFF.md ·
cloudflare-fix.md · all historical round-NN.md · the old design system (`_design/`, `_build/design-capture/`, old-skin).
**Earlier-deleted:** `DESIGN-DIRECTION.md` (2026-06-16) · `techbrot-blueprint-v4.xlsx` / v3 · `techbrot-design-brief.md`.
**STANDING RULE:** when something changes, UPDATE the owning file above — **never spawn a new overlapping doc.**
If two docs ever disagree, **ARCHITECTURE-TRUTH + the latest founder ruling win**, and reconcile immediately.

## ⭐ CODE-PHASE DESIGN-OWNERSHIP RULE (founder 2026-06-16 — authoritative text in REDESIGN-BRIEF §12)
**Claude Design OWNS the visual design.** At the Design handoff, **Code's FIRST job = CAPTURE the complete
design system into the repo as the locked authoritative source** (tokens: color/type/spacing/motion · every
component's styling · every per-type hero). **Then Code BUILDS all pages by referencing that captured system.**
Code does NOT author/invent CSS or visual design afterward — it implements what Design produced. Minor
adjustments OK; **wholesale CSS/design changes go back through Design, never invented by Code.** Capture
everything at handoff so the build is pure implementation, not redesign-as-you-go.

## ⭐ CODE-PHASE RE-SKIN RULES (founder 2026-06-16 — apply on EVERY page of the re-skin)
**RS1 — STRUCTURAL UPGRADE, NOT RECOLOR.** Where a page uses an OLD/weak cobalt-floor component,
REPLACE it with the BETTER component the HANDOFF already provides. Use **only** handoff
components/structures — never invent or "improve" the design. If a page needs something the handoff
doesn't cover, **STOP and flag** (don't design it). Map old→handoff **consistently** (same old
component always → same handoff upgrade) so the swap is systematic, not page-by-page.
**Old → handoff component map (extend as types are proven):**
- full intake-form (non-baseline) → **call-block** (CALL conversion). Forms stay ONLY on `/contact/`
  + `/file-review/` (full) + state-pillar bottom (minimal 4–5). Everything else converts by CALL.
- legacy `.num` numbered grid (deliverables etc.) → **deliver-card** (non-numbered, brand tie-tick);
  the ONE numbered system per page stays the **process** (premium numbered).
- `.process-diagram` → **premium numbered process** (circle numbers, no grey top rule).
- plain centered hero → **split hero + signature figure** (`heroFigure`) where a signature diagram
  fits the type (t-account home/hub · before/after cleanup/bofu · reconciliation/migration where apt).
- light final CTA → **dark final band** (`ctaBand.dark`) — the ONE earned dark moment.
- review-card misused as pricing → **featured pricing tier** highlight.
- old dropdown nav/footer → **mid-mega nav + light footer accordion** (Gallery 04) — site-wide chrome (PENDING, item 3).
**RS2 — VARIETY GATE (battery `variety-12a`, STANDING).** #12a hard: ≤1 numbered system/page (the 2nd
numbered dataset becomes cards/flow). Pre-elevation debt exempted in `_build/battery/variety-exceptions.json`
(40 pages as of 2026-06-16) — **remove each URL as its TYPE is re-skinned**; the gate then enforces the fix.
#12b adjacency reported (hardens as pages adopt the section--* sequence). Regenerate exceptions:
`python _build/scripts/variety_gen_exceptions.py`; audit: `variety_scan.py`.
**RS3 — RESTYLE/RECOMPOSE ONLY.** Never change heading text, FAQ, intent, URLs, or schema. Equity-GREEN
vs baseline.json on every page. Variety + honesty + forms gates fire on every page.
**RS4 — TYPE WAVES, STOP BETWEEN.** Wave 1 = one real page each of home·hub·guide·state-pillar·contact·
honest-triage → battery GREEN → report URLs → founder spot-check → fan out that type. Wave 2+ =
registry-composed types (product/mofu·comparison·pricing·legal·location-child·file-review). Commit+push per wave.

## ⏳ QUEUED — REPO CLEANUP (founder 2026-06-16; ONLY after re-skin COMPLETE + APPROVED, not during)
Founder has a backup; git history preserves all. **Verify-first → dry-run → list EXACT paths → founder
confirms → delete as its own commit (`clean _build/reports archive`) → confirm clean build → report.**
**DELETE (superseded round logs in `_build/reports/`):** round-7 … round-26-ny-children, round-10-step3,
round-10-step6, round-21-design-audit, round-21-fidelity-replication, round-24-phase0, cloudflare-fix +
any other stale round-NN. **KEEP (LIVE):** PAGE-TYPE-REGISTRY.md, FINAL-MIGRATION-REPORT.md,
MIGRATION-PROTOCOL.md, round-27-capture-plan.md + current-round report, BUILD-TRACKER, ARCHITECTURE-TRUTH,
REDESIGN-BRIEF, baseline.json, equity-exceptions.json. **ALSO propose (don't delete) other now-unneeded
items** (the `_build/design-capture/extracted/` bundle once fully captured, stale scripts, the old bundle if
regenerated) — list + reason, founder confirms. **NEVER touch `/src/`, `_site`, `assets`, config, or any
canonical doc above.**

## ⛳ CUTOVER GATE — FLIP-TO-LIVE PRE-FLIGHT (founder 2026-06-17; flip is NOT just a page count)
Before techbrot.com is pointed at this build, ALL must clear:
1. ✅ **CLEARED — real phone number locked (founder confirmed 2026-06-17).** (877) 751-5575 /
   `tel:+18777515575` is TechBrot's REAL toll-free line — NOT a placeholder. Central token
   `site.phone` in `src/_data/site.json`; chrome (header/footer/nav/drawer/call-bar) + tier
   layouts + the elevated call-block all reference the token. No wrong/old number anywhere
   (the only non-token tel: are contact.njk + tb-forms.js — SAME real number; dev/* samples use a
   fictional 555 number, preview-only/not shipped). Tokenize contact at its proof for single-source.
2. **Real Intuit ProAdvisor badge artwork** in (no stand-ins live).
3. **baseline-vs-live-prod re-crawl** done — `/find-an-accountant/` orphan blind spot + any other
   uncaptured live URL → 301s confirmed so nothing 404s at cutover.
4. **/resources/ interim repoint** resolved or confirmed safe (nav "Resources" → /resources/research/
   until the /resources/ hub ships).
5. **Full re-skin complete + equity-GREEN site-wide + battery green.**
6. ⛔ **LIVE axe + overflow probes on ALL growth-phase children (founder 2026-06-17 — HARD flip blocker).**
   Headless-chrome probes are ENV-BLOCKED in the autonomous build sessions (`chrome --headless --dump-dom`
   returns 0-length DOM on this machine), so the growth-phase city children + glossary were verified by
   **static-proxy + byte-equivalence to the axe-0/27 SF proof**, NOT live. Before flip, axe (`axe_page.ps1`)
   and overflow (`overflow_probe.ps1`) MUST be run LIVE on the founder's machine across **every** growth
   child — all find-an-accountant city children (CA/TX/FL/IL/… as they ship) + the 24 glossary terms — to
   confirm 0 violations / clean 360·390·768. **Do not let inferred-clean stack unverified to flip.** Track the
   running list of inferred-only pages in each round report; this gate clears only when the full set is
   live-confirmed. (Per round 29–32: 21 city children + 24 glossary so far are inferred-clean, pending live run.)
7. ⛔ **CSS MUST NET BACK UNDER TARGET BEFORE FLIP (founder ruling 2026-06-20 — HARD flip blocker).** The
   css-bytes gate was raised to a **~100KB TRANSITION CEILING** (both `_build/battery/run_battery.py` and
   `src/assets/css/site.min.css.11ty.js`) because the design re-architecture layers the new, richer system
   on top of old components that still serve 500+ un-converted pages — so the bundle legitimately grows
   mid-transition. This ~100KB is NOT the final budget. Before flip, run the css-trim pass (`css_audit.py`)
   to drop every superseded legacy component rule and **lower the gate back toward the elevated target**
   (set the final figure at trim time). The flip does not clear until the minified bundle is back under
   that tightened target.

## ⚡ PACE — PER-TYPE PROOF, THEN AUTOMATE FAN-OUT (founder 2026-06-17)
Move fast. Prove ONE page of each remaining type → founder glances fast → then AUTOMATE the fan-out
of that whole type (founder reviews ~one page per type, NOT every page). After a type's proof is
OK'd, fan it out automatically; report URLs in the round block; keep moving toward ~200. State
pillar: prove the **NY pillar + one NY child** specifically (NY is the only built-out state).
Sequence: nav nowrap fix → hub proof → guide → NY pillar + NY child → contact → triage. Commit per step.

## FIND-AN-ACCOUNTANT PHASE (spec 2026-06-15) — deploys AFTER QB silo 1 + vs + partners, BEFORE accounting; accounting silo LAST
Scope: **NY is the only state built out** (pillar + 39-page tree). **CA/TX/FL/IL parked via
temporary 301** (no content build) — scheduled for full build-out POST-REDESIGN on the new
system; redirects removed when the real pages ship. PHASE 0 dependency report:
`_build/reports/round-24-phase0.md`. NY tree = 39 (pillar 1 · cities-hub 1 · cities 11 ·
industries-hub 1 · industries 8 · service-children 17). t-location is a NEW unproven tier →
**prove the NY pillar SOLO first (own review), then children in ~5-page protocol waves.** Every
NY page: equity GREEN + enriched to goal + REAL NY local specificity (NY/NYC tax, not a mad-lib
— NY is the template-quality bar for all future states), correct local schema, t-location
design-fidelity, pillar↔children↔siblings + location↔service-silo interlinking. Report ends with
an explicit t-location verdict. NY in-content links to /accounting/* (5 not-yet-built targets)
will 404 on preview until the accounting silo (last) ships — founder accepts (not severe).

**✅ NY SILO COMPLETE (2026-06-15, round 26) — pillar + all 38 children migrated, committed,
verified.** 8 waves on the proven t-location tier: 12 cities-tier · 9 industries · 13 standard
services · 4 honest-triage services (business-tax-problems, state-tax-notice-help, urgent-bookkeeping,
speak-to-a-proadvisor — founder-approved autonomous Sheet-7 build, disclosure-above-fold,
overclaims reframed). Every page equity GREEN · axe 0 · overflow clean 360/390/768 · CSS 55,933 B.
Full log: `_build/reports/round-26-ny-children.md`. Commits `9056d8a`→`b21f80d`. **OPEN (founder):**
a few frozen baseline meta_descriptions on the honest-triage pages brush the SLA/options line
(urgent "Same-day response, CPA-ready in days"; biztax "see your options") — kept verbatim as SEO
equity, visible pages reframed/honest; founder to decide keep-vs-reframe. **NEXT:** the 4 state
landings CA/TX/FL/IL (real per-state tax content, t-location, no children yet), same R7 autonomy.
NOTE: the FIND-AN-ACCOUNTANT PHASE spec above said CA/TX/FL/IL were "parked via 301" — SUPERSEDED by
the revised spec (no redirects; CA/TX/FL/IL ship as real landing pages now, children post-redesign).

**✅ FIND-AN-ACCOUNTANT SILO COMPLETE (2026-06-15, round 26) — 43/43 baselines migrated.** NY (pillar +
38 children, 8 waves) + CA/TX/FL/IL state landings (landing-only; children post-redesign). All on the
validated t-location tier: equity GREEN · axe 0 · overflow clean 360/390/768 · CSS 55,933 B. Commits
`9056d8a`→`de3df13`. Honest-triage metas reframed per founder (commit `e5e0c21`). **Patterns banked:**
state landing = clone NY pillar + `heroMotif: motif-align-full.svg` (t-location layout now takes a
`heroMotif` override; neutral motif, not a wrong-state contour) + real per-state tax content + NO links
to non-existent children (route to `/contact/?intent=<state>`) + explicit `<state>`/`<state>-advisory`
intents (battery intent check is static). Pricing/comparison tables MUST use `vs-scroll`+`vs-table`, never
`proof-strip__item` buyer-cards (nowrap → mobile overflow; caught + fixed on CA). **NEXT (R7 autonomy):**
QB-remainder (6) → vs (5) → partners (1) → accounting (39, LAST). Deploy order unchanged.

**✅ QB-REMAINDER + VS SILO COMPLETE (2026-06-15, round 26).** QB-remainder (6): 5 migration children
(desktop-to-online, migration-cleanup, other-software-to-qb, quickbooks-to-xero t-bofu, balances-wrong-
after-conversion t-guide HowTo — commit `5739ddd`) + speak-to-a-quickbooks-expert (t-bofu honest-triage,
founder-approved solo, `28cf794`/`f032703`, wired to the existing quickbooks-speak-expert intent). vs silo
(5): hub + bookkeeper-vs-accountant + techbrot-vs-bench/pilot/quickbooks-live (t-mofu, `66f0e42`). All
equity GREEN · axe 0 · overflow clean 360/390/768 · CSS 55,933 B. vs honesty: fair vs-table (where they
win); Bench Dec-2024 shutdown reflected; Pilot unverifiable stats dropped (qualitative); QB-Live 2024
restructure + not-Intuit independence stated, fabricated pricing removed. OPEN (low-risk, founder): Pilot
published pricing + re-verify QB-Live current status before go-live.

## ⛔ POST-MIGRATION GOVERNING RULE (founder, 2026-06-15) — STEP-BY-STEP, GATED, NOT AUTONOMOUS
Migration is COMPLETE (139/139, cutover parity). **The R7 autonomy rule was MIGRATION-ONLY and no longer
applies.** From here, work proceeds ONE DELIVERABLE AT A TIME: after EACH deliverable, STOP, report, and
WAIT for the founder's explicit GO before starting the next. These are high-stakes / low-volume judgment
steps — gated, not autonomous. Do NOT batch or run ahead.

**POST-MIGRATION SEQUENCE (roadmap; execute one-at-a-time with a founder gate at each):**
- **0. Reconcile all governing docs** — bring BUILD-TRACKER, PAGE-TYPE-REGISTRY, DESIGN-DIRECTION,
  FINAL-MIGRATION-REPORT, equity-exceptions current + mutually consistent; flag/resolve contradictions to
  the latest founder rulings. *(in progress this turn, then STOP)*
- **1. Complete the redesign review queue** (+ A4 hero check). ✅ DONE 2026-06-15 · **✅ GO (founder 2026-06-16)** —
  A4 RESOLVED (all 38 NY children clone the pillar's full t-location hero unconditionally → reinforces
  t-bofu re-tier for conversion children); DECISION-READY re-tiering queue at the top of
  FINAL-MIGRATION-REPORT (① 20 high-confidence re-tier · ② 26 review · ③ rest keep). **Queue executes INSIDE the
  redesign phase (before cutover), per plan.**
- **2. ARCHITECTURE-TRUTH** — `ARCHITECTURE-TRUTH.md` (repo root; was `TECHBROT-BLUEPRINT-V5.md`, RENAMED
  2026-06-15). ✅ DRAFTED 2026-06-15, post-review corrections (`226fb74`), **✅ RE-APPROVED (founder 2026-06-16 —
  corrected v5 is good)**. The source-of-truth
  architecture doc (§0 identity/non-negotiables · §1 URL+silo 139 · §2 type/tier DECIDED · §3 state strategy ·
  §4 design · §5 sequence/governance · §6 factory · §7 growth backlog · §8 honesty · §9 opens · §10 doc map).
  Supersedes v4/v3.xlsx + design-brief where they disagree. Nothing depends on it until founder-approved.
- **3. Verify + delete the old Bootstrap-Studio per-route folders.** ✅ DONE 2026-06-15 (pulled forward, founder
  GO). Verified safety (139/139; baseline.json holds equity independent of old HTML; battery reads
  baseline.json + _site + src, never old folders; build input=src only), deleted 10 root folders / 139 files
  (about·accounting·contact·find-an-accountant·legal·partners·pricing·quickbooks·trust·vs) via `git rm`,
  commit `2393e16`. Post-delete: clean build → _site (148 pages) + _redirects intact; battery GREEN (exit 0,
  links 15667 resolve, zero broken refs). `contact/` added to the delete list per founder (I flagged it as the
  one unlisted old folder). Removes the repo-root-serving fallback risk before cutover. src/ untouched;
  recoverable via git + founder backup.
- **4. Gap analysis** (redesign scope + proving set). ✅✅ **COMPLETE — REDESIGN-BRIEF.md is FINAL (founder
  2026-06-16).** All Deliverable-4 specs live in `REDESIGN-BRIEF.md` §13 (reconciled with the as-built system).
  Read the founder's strategy brief (`REDESIGN-BRIEF.md`
  §0–§12) + grounded it: §13.1 as-built component map (EXISTS vs NET-NEW, real classes) · §13.2 the 3 approved
  component-kit changes (call-breakout→PRIMARY · net-new minimal state-pillar form · PLACEMENT-MAP rewrite) ·
  §13.3 forms-ruling registry/placement-map delta · §13.4 honest-triage compliance re-spec (⚠ FOUNDER SIGN-OFF) ·
  §13.5 gap-analysis checklist · §13.6 grounded proving set (real URLs) · §13.7 doc-system flag. **No code/registry
  edits (specs only); the registry/PLACEMENT-MAP propagation is deferred to brief-final / the Code phase.**
  **FOUNDER RULINGS FOLDED IN:** ✅ 3 component changes RATIFIED (§13.2) · ✅ honest-triage wording **SIGNED OFF
  2026-06-16** (§13.4, Sheet-7 compliant) · ✅ doc-system: REDESIGN-BRIEF = canonical CREATIVE truth,
  **DESIGN-DIRECTION.md DELETED** (2026-06-16; git history preserves it) · ✅ `/contact/` + `/file-review/` =
  premium conversion-form page TYPE (§13.8) · ✅ proving set FINAL one-per-type (§13.6) · ✅ **design-quality rules
  folded in 2026-06-16** — section rhythm/anti-monotony (only 1 numbered system/page · no adjacent same-looking
  sections · deliberate variety) woven into §9 + motion §6 + nav/breadcrumb/mobile-footer-accordion §4 + the
  section-rhythm design-fidelity GATE additions §13.9. **No code/registry edits (specs only); registry/PLACEMENT-MAP
  propagation + the §13.9 gate checks land in the Code phase.**
  **⚠ NOTE:** `DESIGN-DIRECTION.md` had earlier been deleted from the working tree (unstaged — R4 explicit-add
  hygiene kept it out of every commit); confirmed by founder + now deleted intentionally as part of the doc-system
  consolidation. **NEXT: the brief is FINAL → founder takes it to Claude Design** (generate the visual system as
  OPTIONS — palette/type/signature + the §13.6 proving pages mocked); NOT Code building yet.
- **→ then the REDESIGN** (separate phase, per REDESIGN-BRIEF.md; includes the re-tiering pass).
- **→ CUTOVER is the LAST step** — nothing goes live until the redesign is done and founder-signed-off.

The latest founder rulings the docs must agree with: hubs route = **t-hub**; conversion children =
**t-bofu**; **t-location only the pillar**; honesty = illustrative-not-fabricated (R5); state strategy =
**NY full + CA/TX/FL/IL landings now, other states' children post-redesign**; **cutover LAST, after the
signed-off redesign**.

**RULING — `/find-an-accountant/` bare national landing (founder, 2026-06-15):** intentionally removed for
quality; **NOT a gap to restore now.** Rebuilt FRESH post-redesign as a proper net-new t-hub national landing.
State pillars (CA/FL/IL/NY/TX) top the silo until then. **CUTOVER CHECK (verified this turn): the URL is LIVE
(HTTP 200) on production techbrot.com today** (a "50-state coverage" landing) but is ABSENT from baseline.json.
→ **301 STAGED ✅ (founder confirmed target `/accounting/`, 2026-06-15):** `src/redirects.njk` emits
`/_redirects` with `/find-an-accountant/  /accounting/  301` (commit `939fffa`); verified the bundle writes
`_site/_redirects` on clean build. National + topical interim target (chosen over the NY pillar to avoid a
national→single-state geo-mismatch). **REMOVE this rule when the real find-an-accountant national landing ships
post-redesign.** **⚠ STILL OPEN — baseline-coverage re-verify:** a live prod URL was missing from the 139
baseline, so **before cutover re-verify baseline == the full live-prod URL set** (possible other uncaptured
live orphans that would 404 at cutover).

### ▶ CURRENT RESUME POINT (recovery anchor — keep current; founder may resume via `claude -c` after power loss)

## 🔵 FRESH-SESSION RESUME (2026-06-17 v2 — founder /clear; read THIS first, then round-28-wave1.md)
**PHASE: GROWTH (flip HELD — build broad coverage first, then flip). RE-SKIN COMPLETE 142/142.**
**MODE: FULLY AUTONOMOUS.** Run non-stop; commit per wave; round report + COUNT line + every URL each turn.
**RECORD-DON'T-STOP:** flag decisions/judgment calls to a list in the round report and KEEP GOING; only HARD-STOP
on (a) a battery failure you can't cleanly fix, or (b) an equity/honesty gate breach. (The earlier 5 per-type
STOP-gates are RETIRED — glossary, the CA state-child, and the find-an-accountant hub are all founder-APPROVED.)
GATES every page: variety #12a/#12b · honesty · forms · CLS 0 · axe · overflow · (equity n/a for net-new growth).

🏗️ DESIGN RE-ARCHITECTURE — STEP 1 PREP ✅ DONE (2026-06-19, founder ask; NOT a redesign — sample set + signature map + URL export only). Parsed all built pages → ordered SECTION SIGNATURE per page (script `_build/scripts/section_signature.py`, re-runnable). 586 live URLs (580 shipped + 6 dev). 179 raw signatures roll up to **25 shipped page-type families**. Deliverables: `_build/reports/SECTION-SIGNATURE-MAP.md` (the handoff: family→ordered sections→richest representative→count→AI-summary/final-CTA treatment per type) · `live-urls-v5.txt` (STEP-2 URL export) · `_page-family-map.txt`/`_families.txt`/`_signature-clusters.txt` (data). KEY FINDINGS for Design: (a) TWO body languages today — 177 prose pages (D2: QB/resources informational+help/error) vs 66 card/service pages (D1); (b) NY find-an-accountant children are hand-authored per page (each its own raw signature) while CA/TX/FL/IL are partial-generated/consistent — redesign targets the partial, NY re-aligns to it. **STEP 3 ✅ DONE (2026-06-19): 25 synthetic KITCHEN-SINK reference pages built under `/dev/kitchen-sink-<FAM>-*/` (one per family, preview-only/noindex/sitemap-excluded/`permalink:false` in prod — verified prod build emits 0 /dev). Each = the UNION of every section variant its type uses, canonical order, REAL composite content, CURRENT component system (the "before"), devlabel box stating family + live-page count + sub-shapes. Built by 5 parallel agents from the built-HTML; spec `_build/reports/KITCHEN-SINK-SPEC.md`. Verified: 25/25 noindex + devlabel, exactly 1 head-only JSON-LD (none in `<main>`), D1 carries BOTH conversion seams (intake-form + call-block), D7 honest-triage disclosure high. Contract `_build/reports/DESIGN-CONTRACT.md` = FREE (all visuals/layout/components/per-type UX incl. AI-summary+final-CTA) vs FROZEN (URLs · content/copy · headings + question-wording · FAQ visible-text==FAQPage-schema verbatim · TL;DR/speakable selectable · heading hierarchy · the JSON-LD graph; Code re-attaches schema to the new design).** B3 listing-hub CTA = DARK (founder ruling 2026-06-19: B3 is a hub family → dark, consistent with Home/silo-hubs/research; the SECTION-SIGNATURE-MAP already listed it dark). Fix: dropped frontmatter ctaBand (t-guide hardcodes a light band + ignores ctaBand.dark) and authored the dark `section--cta-band--dark`+`section--tier-hub` band directly in the B3 body — no shared layout modified. Verified: B3 renders 1 dark band, 0 light. **STEP 4 ✅ DONE (2026-06-19): package HANDED OFF to Claude Design** via DesignSync → project "TechBrot Design System" (cac95025-1c16-4d8d-aaf6-c4b15f052481, the founder's claude.ai/design). Pushed 30 files, ADDITIVE only (new `uploads/kitchen-sink/` folder; nothing existing touched; Westgate project untouched per rule #8): 5 docs at `uploads/kitchen-sink/` (INDEX.md, DESIGN-CONTRACT.md, SECTION-SIGNATURE-MAP.md, KITCHEN-SINK-SPEC.md, live-urls-v5.txt) + 25 self-contained pages at `uploads/kitchen-sink/pages/` (site.min.css inlined so each renders standalone; fonts fall back — brand faces are in the project's tokens/fonts.css). Staging script `_build/scripts/stage_design_handoff.py`; index `_build/reports/DESIGN-HANDOFF-INDEX.md`. Verified all 30 landed via list_files. **NEXT: Claude Design produces the redesign (per DESIGN-CONTRACT FREE/FROZEN); then Code implements + re-attaches schema; then CUTOVER (last).**
🧭 v5 SYNC ✅ DONE (2026-06-20, founder ask): read `techbrot-blueprint-v5.xlsx` (6 sheets) = the new STRATEGIC truth; reconciled ARCHITECTURE-TRUTH.md to it (top banner carries the conflict-delta table; §1/§4/§7 tagged stale; §10 doc map updated) and added v5 as item 0 of the CANONICAL DOC SYSTEM above. v5 confirms: 586 live (393 core + 193 location), build content COMPLETE, two things left = (1) DESIGN RE-ARCHITECTURE [Claude Design NOW actively building a complete NEW visual system — fresh direction, NOT old cobalt/teal] (2) THE FLIP (v5 Sheet 5 gate, 8 items). No code/redirect conflicts found — `src/redirects.njk` already current (find-an-accountant + /reviews/ 301s already removed; only /about/team/ + growth dup-merges remain), matching v5's corrected redirect rule.
🎯 IMPLEMENTATION RULE (confirmed, STAND BY — Design still producing, do NOT start): when the design handoff comes, REPLACE the entire VISUAL system (old cobalt/teal CSS + component styling + layouts) with Design's new system — new look entirely, old visual/UX does NOT carry over. PRESERVE the FROZEN skeleton-of-meaning (DESIGN-CONTRACT / v5 Sheet 3): every URL · all content/copy · headings + question-form wording · FAQ Q&A block == FAQPage schema verbatim · TL;DR/speakable selectable · valid heading hierarchy · the full JSON-LD graph. Re-attach schema to the new markup per family. Scope = complete re-architecture across ~580 pages via shared token/CSS/layout layers, family by family, equity-safe — one final careful pass.
🧹 PRE-IMPL CLEANUP ✅ DONE (2026-06-20, isolated commit): archived stale → `/_archive/` (git-tracked, reversible — 71 round logs + superseded docs incl. PAGE-TYPE-REGISTRY/REDESIGN-BRIEF/PREMIUM-UPGRADE-PLAN + old design system `_design/`/design-capture/old-skin + 29 dead one-off scripts); hard-deleted only the 🔴 regenerable bucket (scratch _*.txt, design-handoff staging, design-transfer bins, _build/verify|tmp|serve.log). KEPT untouched: src/, baseline.json, battery, capture data, active scripts, governing docs, root assets/ (live photo source), v5.xlsx. Clean build GREEN (exit 0, 611 pages — nothing was a build input). Script: `_build/scripts/cleanup_archive.sh`. 📓 SESSION-LOG.md started (rolling per-turn log, standing rule). **ORDER NOW: Phase 0 foundation (fonts/tokens/chrome/diagrams/badges/gates) → G1 legal + D1 cleanup PROOF → ⛔ PAUSE for founder spot-check before any fan-out.** Build-plan approved: form-handler scaffold (flip-gate #3), B4/B5 map-by-file, Phase-0 whole-look-on-noindex OK, commit-per-batch + first-page spot-check.
**COUNT: total pages live = 581 (orientation `*.html` non-dev; round-97 577 + 3 frameworks + 1 hub) · re-skinned (142) + growth = 439 · LAST COMMIT = D1 cleanup-bookkeeping STRUCTURAL REBUILD proof + css-bytes gate→100KB transition ceiling + 2 battery-infra fixes (manifest path→_archive, UTF-8 stdout); battery FULL GREEN. Working tree clean on `preview-11ty`.
🎯 NOW (design re-architecture, Phase 0 done): G1 (legal) + D1 (cleanup money-page) restyle proofs DELIVERED + battery-GREEN + live on LAN for founder judgment (PC+phone). ⛔ PAUSE — do NOT fan out until founder signs off both vs the design templates. css-bytes is a ~100KB TRANSITION ceiling (flip-gate item 7 = must net back under target before flip via css_audit.py). Pending founder-gated to-do: regenerate CLASS-MANIFEST from live CSS (~318 vs stale 208). On GO: fan out the design system family-by-family (D-family money pages next), equity-safe + battery-GREEN each.
🧩 FRAMEWORKS HUB ✅ COMPLETE (round 98) — /frameworks/ hub (DefinedTermSet) + 4 framework pages: compounding-reconciliation-drift (cleanup) · historical-accounting-debt (catch-up) · techbrot-setup-protocol (setup, NOT Intuit-official) · migration-integrity-protocol (migration). All coined CONCEPTS not stats, zero invented numbers, t-guide DefinedTerm. CONSOLIDATION done: money-page inline DefinedTerms repointed to canonical #term @ids (pricing/cleanup ×2, pricing/quickbooks-setup + termsOfService, migration/freshbooks, migration/sage; resources/research skipped = dataset). ONE canonical DefinedTerm per framework. Battery GREEN. Report: round-98.md.
⭐ AUTHORITY + REVENUE LAYERS BOTH COMPLETE. Remaining lanes (founder's call, lower priority): supporting children (trust/partners/careers) · blog/glossary expansion · optional /quickbooks/training online+payroll children. Highest-leverage moves now = FLIP-GATE (not pages): live axe/overflow on ~430 growth pages [founder machine] · form handler · Intuit badge · baseline-vs-prod re-crawl · OG images. + data-gated proof loop (capturing now).
🎨 RESKIN READINESS ✅ CONFIRMED + HANDOFF PREPPED (round 98, founder ask; NOT started — pre-flip restyle, equity-safe). `_build/reports/RESKIN-HANDOFF.md` = the Design handoff: readiness verdict (css-drift+manifest gates prove token-based/no-orphans) · 10-layer CSS architecture + which layers to touch · current component/class inventory (grouped) · 7 page-type layouts + variants (tool/triage/glossary/location-children/article) · 2 reference targets (cleanup-bookkeeping BOFU + NY t-location pillar) · equity-safe method (touch only src/assets/css/*; tokens=01, chrome=04; content/URLs/schema untouched). ⚠ ONE PREP ITEM: CLASS-MANIFEST.md (208, dated 2026-06-13) is STALE — live CSS ships ~318 classes (growth components call-block/calc/deliver-card/diagram-feature/disclosure-triage/hero--split in 08-09 layers, token-based/battery-clean, NOT orphans); REGENERATE the manifest from live CSS before Design works against it. Reskin runs token/CSS-layer level so all pages inherit; same as skin #1.
PRIOR — round-97 frameworks PROOF + capture-loop. Working tree clean on `preview-11ty`.
⏸ STOP — FRAMEWORKS PROOF awaiting founder glance (NEW TYPE). /frameworks/compounding-reconciliation-drift/ (t-guide, DefinedTerm in NEW set "TechBrot Accounting & QuickBooks Frameworks"). Coined CONCEPT not a stat (zero invented numbers); ties to cleanup money pages. Battery GREEN (fixed faq-schema-verbatim: stripTags tags→"" not " "). PREVIEW: https://techbrot-preview.pages.dev/frameworks/compounding-reconciliation-drift/ · Report: round-97.md.
ON FOUNDER GO — fan out in ONE turn: Historical Accounting Debt (catch-up) · TechBrot Setup Protocol (setup) · Migration Integrity Protocol (migration) + /frameworks/ HUB (DefinedTermSet, links 4) + repoint money-page inline DefinedTerms to the canonical framework pages. (Use stripTags tags→"" .)
✅ CAPTURE LOOP set up (round 97, founder ask): CAPTURE-TEMPLATES §7 engagement-results + §8 reviews/review-request loop + _build/data/{engagement-results,reviews-pipeline}.json — collecting, N-gated, publishes nothing. Research pipeline (6 datasets + intake capture) confirmed intact.
📋 FLIP-GATE CHECKLIST delivered to founder (11 items). Critical path: (#5) LIVE axe/overflow on ~430 growth pages [founder machine] · (#6) real form handler [also unblocks scheduler + AI-capture + review-request trigger] · (#7) Intuit badge artwork [founder supplies]. Mine on cue: (#8) baseline-vs-prod re-crawl · (#9) OG images · (#10) /resources/ repoint confirm.
PRIOR — round-96 year-end-close (buildable BOFU surface complete). Working tree clean on `preview-11ty`.
🎯 BUILDABLE BOFU SURFACE ✅ COMPLETE (round 96) — /quickbooks/year-end-close/ (seasonal, operational close-in-QB, 1099 folded in, tax-lane honest, distinct from year-end-review/payroll-year-end/month-end-close/checklist). Battery GREEN (fixed 4 escaped-quote hrefs + de-numbered deliverables grid). Report: round-96.md.
⭐ REVENUE/CONVERSION SURFACE COMPLETE on buildable BOFU (rounds 90–96): QB money layer (hire-a-proadvisor·proadvisor-cost·bookkeeping-services·training) · pricing+5 children · 6 industry high-fee · 4 into-QB migrations · proadvisor-near-me · full /vs/ set · year-end-close. Nothing buildable-BOFU remains.
⏸ HELD (founder): guarantee page (REAL terms only) · scheduler/book-a-call (flip infra, parked w/ form handler).
🛑 DATA-GATED (no fabrication): /results/ · /case-studies/ · /reviews/by-X/ — fixable only via the engagement/review capture loop (calendar-time). TOP conversion ceiling.
📚 NON-BOFU lanes open (founder's call, lower call-yield): coined-frameworks hub (~6, AI-citation/MOFU — best remaining authority play) · supporting children (trust/partners/careers) · blog/glossary expansion · optional /quickbooks/training/ online+payroll children.
PRIOR — round-95 three competitor /vs/ pages. Working tree clean on `preview-11ty`.
⚖️ /vs/ ADDITIONS (Sheet-8) ✅ DONE (round 95) — /vs/techbrot-vs-bookkeeper360/ + /vs/techbrot-vs-xendoo/ (competitor, full shape) + /vs/local-cpa-vs-online-bookkeeping/ (role/structure, shared partial). Hub wired: statuses flipped to Published, DUPLICATE bookkeeper360 card fixed, local-cpa added, ItemList +3. HONESTY: no fabricated competitor pricing (deferred to vendor), fair win/loss tallies (never a sweep), local-cpa=complementary (we don't file taxes / use both, non-disparaging). Battery GREEN first pass (proactive checks). Report: round-95.md.
NEXT (round 96, founder-confirmed): /quickbooks/year-end-close/ (seasonal BOFU) — the LAST buildable BOFU tail item. After it, revenue/conversion surface is effectively COMPLETE bar HELD items + data-gated proof.
PRIOR — round-94 proadvisor-near-me. Working tree clean on `preview-11ty`.
📍 PROADVISOR-NEAR-ME ✅ DONE (round 94) — /quickbooks/proadvisor-near-me/ (t-bofu). Honest national near-me answer: remote-first, NO LocalBusiness schema / no fabricated offices, Service areaServed=US (+5 built states), routes to /find-an-accountant/ + 5 pillars. call-block added (BOFU handoff). Battery GREEN. Report: round-94.md.
⚠ 11ty STALE-RENDER LESSON: non-clean `npx eleventy` can leave an edited page's prior render in _site (masked the call-block fix). USE `rm -rf _site` before battery-critical rebuilds.
NEXT (round 95, founder-confirmed): 3 competitor /vs/ — techbrot-vs-bookkeeper360, techbrot-vs-xendoo, vs-local-cpa (established /vs/ shared-partial pattern + hub update; fair, no fabricated competitor pricing; vs-local-cpa = complementary honesty, we keep books / CPA files). THEN /quickbooks/year-end-close/ (seasonal) — closes the buildable BOFU tail.
PRIOR — round-93 into-QB migration split. Working tree clean on `preview-11ty`.
🔀 INTO-QB MIGRATION SPLIT ✅ DONE (round 93) — /quickbooks/migration/{xero,wave,freshbooks,sage}-to-quickbooks/ (t-bofu, cloned from other-software-to-qb). Built-but-thin fix: exact-match migration searches no longer share one diluted page. Generic other-software-to-qb KEPT as umbrella (not 301'd), enriched with inbound links to the 4 (baseline equity GREEN). spreadsheets SKIPPED (already at /quickbooks/setup/migration-from-spreadsheets/). HONESTY: honest transfer caveats, fair-to-competitor (Sage Intacct downgrade-honesty), no fabricated competitor pricing, canonical migration pricing only, cross-linked to /quickbooks/compare/quickbooks-vs-X/. Battery GREEN after 2 fixes (variety-12a de-number coverage grid; invalid intent quickbooks-online removed). Report: round-93.md.
⚠ RECURRING TEMPLATE GOTCHA: ecommerce/home-services/other-software-to-qb templates carry a numbered grid (.num) AND a process-diagram = 2 numbered systems; source pages are variety-exempt but CLONES are not → pre-emptively de-number the parallel grid on clone, and validate agent intents vs intents.json before battery.
NEXT (round 94, founder-confirmed): /quickbooks/proadvisor-near-me/ — national near-me answer page (honest remote-first, NO LocalBusiness schema/no fabricated offices, routes to /find-an-accountant/ + 5 state pillars, intent=quickbooks-proadvisor). THEN: 3 competitor /vs/ (bookkeeper360, xendoo, local-cpa) + /quickbooks/year-end-close/ (seasonal). ~5-page tail = effectively revenue-complete on buildable BOFU.
PRIOR — round-92 industry high-fee (6 verticals). Working tree clean on `preview-11ty`.
🏭 INDUSTRY HIGH-FEE ✅ DONE (round 92) — /accounting/industries/{property-management, amazon-sellers, shopify-sellers, short-term-rentals, law-firm-trust-accounting, specialty-trades}/ (t-mofu, cloned from closest parent, distinct sub-vertical depth, linked-not-restated). 1 consolidated specialty-trades (NOT 3-way split). TRUST-FUND BOUNDARY held (records/reconcile only, never hold/disburse; attorney/manager controls funds; ethics/tax deferred to bar/CPA/authority). Hub extended +6 rows. variety-12a fix: de-numbered the ecommerce/home-services deliverables grid (kept process-diagram as the 1 numbered system). Battery GREEN. Report: round-92.md.
NEXT (round 93, founder-confirmed): into-QB migration SPLIT — break generic /quickbooks/migration/other-software-to-qb/ into exact-match children (xero/wave/sage/freshbooks-to-quickbooks); spreadsheets SKIPPED (already at /quickbooks/setup/migration-from-spreadsheets/); keep generic page as umbrella hub (not 301'd). Built-but-thin fix: high-intent migration searches shouldn't share one diluted page.
🛑 DO-NOT-BUILD (founder, this lane): /results/ + /case-studies/ (data-gated, no fabrication) · switching-away/reverse-leave-QB (off-brand/cannibalizing) · /quickbooks/emergency/ (covered by help/emergency-help).
⏸ HOLD-FOR-FOUNDER: risk-reversal/guarantee page (ONLY with real guarantee terms — don't invent) · direct booking/scheduler (flip-gate infra, park with form handler).
PRIOR — round-91 pricing children (5 BOFU per-service pricing pages). Working tree clean on `preview-11ty`.
💵 PRICING CHILDREN ✅ DONE (round 91) — /pricing/{bookkeeping,cleanup,payroll,cfo,quickbooks-setup}/ (t-bofu, cloned from /pricing/, canonical Sheet-0 figures only, cannibalization guard: link /pricing/ overview + service page, don't restate). /pricing/ got a "Detailed pricing, by service" inbound section. HONESTY: removed an unconfirmed "ProAdvisor subscription discount" line from quickbooks-setup (contradicted no-commission stance). design-fidelity fix: added "path to a fixed fee" flow to cfo/cleanup/payroll (BOFU handoff component). Battery GREEN. Report: round-91.md.
🟢 RESEARCH LAYER (founder ruling round 91): "parallel" = capture pipeline + collecting-state scaffolds ONLY (8 dataset JSONs + intake AI-lead-source capture + CAPTURE-TEMPLATES.md intact, honest at N=0). ZERO published numbers until a dataset hits N≥20 with sample size disclosed. NOT a build lane.
🔧 ROUND-90 FLAGS RESOLVED (founder): Flag B virtual-accounting KEEP · Flag D checklist→guide canonical KEEP · training honesty copy founder-spot-checks (live, not blocking).
NEXT (in progress, round 92): industry high-fee ~6 — property-management · amazon-sellers · shopify-sellers · short-term-rentals · law-firm-trust-accounting + 1 consolidated specialty-trades. TRUST-FUND BOUNDARY (founder): records/reconcile only, NEVER hold/control/disburse client/tenant/escrow/IOLTA funds; defer legal/tax specifics to attorney/CPA + authority.
PRIOR — round-90 QB money pages (distinct-only) + merges. Working tree clean on `preview-11ty`.
🎯 QB MONEY PAGES ✅ DONE (round 90) — founder ruling: build genuinely-distinct only, skip-don't-pad. Of the proposed ~18, **4 built, the rest merged/skipped** (the QB silo's ~140 pages already own most of the intent).
  BUILT (4 t-mofu, cloned from consulting.njk): /quickbooks/hire-a-proadvisor/ (transactional engagement) · /quickbooks/training/ (training hub — dropped the 3-way split as padding) · /quickbooks/proadvisor-cost/ (cost explainer, defers to /pricing/) · /quickbooks/bookkeeping-services/ (flagship QB-platform bookkeeping).
  SKIPPED as dup/thin/off-brand: catch-up (=/accounting/bookkeeping/catch-up-bookkeeping/) · emergency-triage (=help/emergency-help) · book-a-call (=/contact/) · desktop-discontinuation (=desktop/support-end-dates) · inventory · year-end-close · proadvisor-near-me (=find-an-accountant) · switching-away · reverse-migrations 0-of-4 (QB→Xero exists; rest off-brand for a QB ProAdvisor firm).
  MERGES/FIXES: FLAG A → 301 /accounting/pricing/ → /pricing/ (was a growth page, NOT baseline; src removed via git rm, 1 inbound link repointed). FLAG B → KEPT virtual-accounting (distinct cloud-delivery angle; ⚠ flagged as thinnest pair, founder may overrule). FLAG C/D KEPT DISTINCT; FLAG D → printable QB-setup checklist now canonicals to the full guide (added `canonicalUrl` override to base.njk, single-source; ⚠ trade-off: de-indexes printable for the head keyword).
  HONESTY: canonical pricing only (range, estimate-not-a-quote) · no fabricated stats/reviews/clients/dates · no Review/AggregateRating · founder-name-zero · not-Intuit + no-commission + we-don't-file-taxes every page · training also states we don't issue ProAdvisor certification. No new CTA labels, no new intents. Battery GREEN on a clean rebuild. Report: `_build/reports/round-90.md`.
  ⚠ OPEN (founder, non-blocking): (1) overrule Flag B 301? (2) Flag D canonical trade-off OK? (3) spot-check /quickbooks/training/ honesty copy. (4) FLIP-BLOCKER #6 grows: 4 new pages join inferred-clean list.
🟢 BLOG PROOF founder-built (round 87) — awaiting glance but NOT blocking.
NEXT (founder's call): coined-frameworks hub (6, NEW type — needs a proof) · industry high-fee (6) · pricing/partners/trust/legal/careers children (HONESTY-GATED). DEFERRED (real-data gate): results, case-studies, reviews-by-X, research flagships.
PRIOR /vs/ Wave A (round 88): 3 competitor comparisons:
1-800Accountant + Bookkeeper.com cloned from techbrot-vs-bench shape; bench-vs-quickbooks-live = competitor-vs-competitor neutral, TechBrot as
independent third option). HONESTY: fair reads, competitor named where it fits, NO fabricated competitor pricing (deferred to vendor), competitors
described from public info as of review date, Bench shutdown stated as documented, QuickBooks Live = Intuit's (never imply affiliation, defer current
details to Intuit), TechBrot-does-not-file-taxes stated. Battery GREEN (forward cross-link to Wave B page resolved by queueing the 4 Wave B URLs).
NEXT: Wave B = 4 role/structure comparisons (bookkeeper-vs-cpa, cpa-vs-ea, bookkeeping-firm-vs-freelancer, in-house-vs-outsourced-bookkeeping) on the
bookkeeper-vs-accountant shape; then update /vs/ hub listing (src/vs.11tydata.js). THEN backlog: QB money pages ~18 · coined-frameworks hub 6 · industry high-fee 6 · pricing/partners/trust/legal/careers children.
PRIOR: BLOG PROOF (round 87) + TOOLS SILO (rounds 83–86) — detail retained below.
BLOG PROOF ✅ BUILT, BATTERY GREEN. NEW article type. Architecture: t-article layout (firm byline-block + dates, founder-name-zero) · blogCategories.js
→ paginated category.njk generates all 8 category pages · posts as .md in src/blog/posts/ with shared posts.11tydata.js (centralized
BlogPosting+WebPage+Breadcrumb+FAQPage schema) · 11ty auto-collections by tag (collections.post + per-category). 8 seed posts (one per category),
~900–1200 words, 6-FAQ each, internal links to money pages, honest canonical CTAs. HONESTY: zero fabricated stats/partners/testimonials;
partner-spotlight seed is about the PROGRAM (real partner stories only with permission); taxes post stays in-lane ("we don't file taxes"); AI post =
honest "assisted not replaced". Battery GREEN (faq-min-6 caught 8 posts at 5→fixed to 6; intent partner→partner-question fixed).
NEXT (after founder glance): more posts per category as desired, OR next backlog lane (/vs/ additions 7 · QB money pages ~18 · coined-frameworks hub 6 ·
industry high-fee 6 · pricing/partners/trust/legal/careers children).
TOOLS/CALCULATORS SILO ✅ COMPLETE (rounds 83–86) — detail retained below.
🎉 TOOLS/CALCULATORS SILO ✅ COMPLETE (10 pages = /tools/ hub + 9 tools). Rounds 83–86, all battery GREEN. Three JS islands, all client-only/CLS-0/no-network:
  tb-calc.js (band estimators: bookkeeping, cleanup, payroll — canonical-slice bands, can't exceed published ranges) ·
  tb-formula.js (arithmetic on user's OWN numbers: breakeven, cash-runway, budget-worksheet — honest edge handling, math unit-tested) ·
  tb-select.js (1099-deadline = real IRS Jan-31 rule + weekend-roll, date math verified; quickbooks-plan-selector = FEATURE-FIT only, NO Intuit prices).
  sales-tax-rate-lookup = call-based page (NOT a live rate DB, founder ruling) — honest "rates change/address-specific, we look it up with you".
  HONESTY held throughout: canonical pricing only, estimate-not-a-quote everywhere, no fabricated outputs, not-Intuit disclosure, founder-name-zero. 4 tools-CTA labels RATIFIED.
NEXT: BLOG PROOF (NEW article type, founder round 84) — hub + 8 category pages + 8 seed posts; proof-first then STOP for founder glance. Report: `_build/reports/round-86.md`.
ROUND 83 — TOOLS/CALCULATORS proof ✅ BUILT, BATTERY GREEN. First interactive type on the site. Bookkeeping Cost Calculator:
t-mofu tool variant; NEW `tb-calc.js` island (deterministic, client-only, CLS 0, noscript fallback); `.calc` CSS in 09-extensions
(token-only, +~1.8KB min, mobile font step-down on result <480px). HONESTY ENGINEERED: 4 bands are slices of canonical
$400–$2,500+/mo (==Sheet 0); model CANNOT output outside the published range; ALWAYS a range never a point; "estimate not a
quote → exact fee in writing after free discovery call" repeated everywhere. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: same `model` renders selects
+ dumps to #calc-model for JS (no drift). Minimal /tools/ hub built alongside (no-404 floor; t-hub, 6 FAQ; roadmap UNLINKED;
ItemList = live tool only). includeCalcJs gate added to base.njk. url-set queue updated. ⚑ +4 sanctioned CTA labels added
PENDING FOUNDER RATIFICATION ("Get your exact fixed fee" · "See full pricing" · "Skip to the calculator" · "Open the calculator").
ON FOUNDER OK: fan out remaining ~8 calculators (cleanup-cost-estimator, quickbooks-plan-selector [no Intuit plan $], payroll-cost,
sales-tax-rate-lookup [look-up-on-call, NOT a live rate DB], breakeven, cash-runway, 1099-deadline, business-budget-template),
THEN blog proof (8 seed posts per founder). CORRECTION logged: founder's dictated order items 1–3 (/switch/, /resources/,
/accounting-systems+platforms/) + /reviews/ were ALREADY built rounds 80–82 — NOT rebuilt; resumed at item 4.
PLATFORMS+ACCOUNTING-SYSTEMS ✅ DONE (de-risk layer; platform-agnostic advisory; QuickBooks the only real certification listed, others only when real; fair fit-first, no fabricated competitor pricing). Battery note: /platforms/quickbooks used intent=qb-setup (invalid) → fixed to quickbooks-setup. NEXT batch group: (4) tools proof · (5) blog proof.
RESOURCES ✅ DONE (t-guide guides + checklists, t-hub hubs; all free/no-gate; canonical pricing; Intuit/market figures deferred/dated; honesty held). Battery note: hubs need ≥6 FAQ (faq-min-6 gate) — caught+fixed 3 hubs that shipped with 5. NEXT batch group: (3) accounting-systems+platforms (6) · (4) tools proof · (5) blog proof.
⚠ overlap flagged for founder: /resources/checklists/quickbooks-setup-checklist/ (condensed printable) vs /quickbooks/setup/checklist/ (full how-to) — built as cross-linked companion, confirm or merge.
🎉 ACCOUNTING+QUICKBOOKS SILOS v4 ✅ COMPLETE (tasks #16–21). NOW: REMAINING-v4 BUILD (founder 2026-06-18, gap report this session). Confirmed order: (1) switch silo ✅ DONE · (2) resources guides+hub+checklists (~22) · (3) accounting-systems+platforms (6) · (4) tools/calculators (4, NEW type — 1 PROOF first, STOP) · (5) blog (~17, NEW type — PROOF first; seed-post count to confirm) · + /reviews/ ✅ DONE (2 real Clutch reviews, no AggregateRating, 301 removed).
REMAINING after this batch (not yet scheduled): /vs/ additions (9), QB money pages (~18: hire-a-proadvisor, cost, catch-up, bookkeeping-services, inventory, emergency-triage, training×3, year-end-close, book-a-call, desktop-discontinuation, reverse-migrations×4, switching-away, proadvisor-near-me), coined-frameworks hub (6), industry high-fee (6), optional (~27). DEFERRED (real-data gate): results, case-studies, reviews-by-X, research flagships.
NEXT (founder-gated, after remaining v4): FLIP-GATE — LIVE a11y/overflow probes (axe @360/390/768), real form handler, real Intuit badge, baseline-vs-live re-crawl.
⚠ FOUNDER REVIEW (overlap flags, built distinct + cross-linked): /accounting/pricing/ vs /pricing/ · /accounting/small-business-accounting/ vs /accounting/ hub · /accounting/online-bookkeeping/ (delivery) vs /accounting/outsourced-bookkeeping/ (decision) vs monthly-bookkeeping vs virtual-accounting · /accounting/new-business-setup/ (service) vs /quickbooks/setup/new-business/ (file how-to). Confirm splits hold or merge.
⚠ FOUNDER REVIEW: /quickbooks/compare/online-plans/ (capability MATRIX) vs /quickbooks/which-plan-is-right/ (recommendation) — possible intent overlap; built distinct + cross-linked. Confirm split holds or merge.
🏗️ ACCOUNTING+QUICKBOOKS SILOS → FULL v4 (~480) IN PROGRESS (founder 2026-06-18, gap report round-67 + rulings). Order: QB cleanup tiers/scenarios → QB online features → advanced+integrations → comparisons → product/recon/setup/payroll spokes → accounting service spokes → tax-triage last. RULINGS: tax silo = honest-triage ONLY (no literal tax-prep/strategy; sales-tax-filing→merge); speak-to-an-accountant = ProAdvisor-team triage; case-studies = SKIP; 24-7-support = SKIP; dups → 301/merge. Comparisons = NO fabricated competitor pricing. Templates: help-symptom t-guide (cleanup/features), /vs/ vs-table (comparisons), product pages (premier), accounting service shape, state-triage (tax). GAP doc: round-67. Group tasks #16–21.
GROUP 1 (QB cleanup) ✅ COMPLETE (11; file-review skipped as 301 dup). GROUP 2 (QB online features 20+hub / integrations 9+hub / advanced 10+hub): FEATURES ✅ COMPLETE — 20 feature pages + hub /quickbooks/online/features/ (bank-feeds, bank-rules, bills, budgeting, cash-flow-planner, chart-of-accounts, classes, custom-fields, customers, estimates, expenses, inventory, invoices, payroll, products-services, projects, reconciliation, reports, sales-tax, time-tracking). All Features crumbs re-pointed to hub. INTEGRATIONS ✅ COMPLETE — 9 + hub /quickbooks/online/integrations/ (quickbooks-payments, shopify, stripe, paypal, square, bill-com, expensify, gusto, hubspot; cloned feature t-guide reframed as integration explainer: what it does / how to connect & reconcile well / when ProAdvisor helps; net-of-fees + account-mapping honesty theme; not Intuit AND not affiliated with the app). ADVANCED ✅ COMPLETE — 10 + hub /quickbooks/online/advanced/ (custom-report-builder, spreadsheet-sync, workflow-automation, custom-user-roles, batch-transactions, revenue-recognition, fixed-asset-accounting, employee-expense-management, online-backup-restore, performance-center; QBO-Advanced-tier capabilities; revenue-recognition + fixed-assets honestly defer GAAP/tax judgment to CPA; hub honest "many are fine on Plus", no invented Advanced pricing). GROUP 2 DONE. [battery note: agents occasionally inject a `mono` span class for code text — manifest-illegal; use `<code>` instead. caught+fixed on online-backup-restore.]
GROUP 3 (QB comparisons, task #18) ✅ COMPLETE — 7 + hub: clone of /vs/ t-mofu (techbrot-vs-bench) with Bench-only status+migration sections dropped; vs-table per pair (qbo vs competitor); FAIR reads (ProAdvisor preference disclosed, competitor named when it's the better fit); NO fabricated competitor pricing (Wave-core-free + Zoho-free-tier stated qualitatively only, all dollar figures deferred to vendor); online-vs-desktop states the 2024 Desktop new-sale wind-down honestly. NEXT: GROUP 4 = task #19 product/recon/setup/payroll spokes.
FEATURE TEMPLATE: clone help-symptom t-guide (bank-feeds-not-working) reframed as feature explainer (what it does / how to use well / when ProAdvisor helps); intent=quickbooks; ATF not-Intuit disclosure; describe QBO accurately, no fabricated capabilities; hrefs to BUILT pages only (Features crumb→/quickbooks/online/ until hub ships).
🔬 RESEARCH/ORIGINAL-DATA LAYER STARTED (founder 2026-06-18, option 1+4). 6-DATASET PROGRAM, all honest/collecting, N≥20-to-publish, ZERO fabrication: cleanup-benchmarks (existing) + migration-outcomes + lead-source-performance + error-intelligence + industry-benchmarks + systems-selection — JSONs at `_build/data/*.json` (locked schemas). /resources/research/ hub now presents the 6-dataset program with live per-dataset N. SEEDED REAL (founder): 4 page close-rates into lead-source (qb-cost 22% · cleanup 18% · migration 14% · proadvisor-near-me 11%) — INTERNAL-priority only (leads_n unknown → NOT published externally until real denominator + N≥20). AI-LEAD-SOURCE CAPTURE wired into the shared intake form (`partials/intake-form.njk`): "How did you find us?" + "which AI tool (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Perplexity/Copilot)" selects — captures at every intake when the form handler goes live at flip. Founder hands raw closed-engagement facts per `_build/data/CAPTURE-TEMPLATES.md`; I write clean anonymized rows. ⚑ ACTION/PRIORITY (founder): qb-cost + cleanup are the highest converters → prioritize internal linking + strongest CTAs + future-content priority.
✅ SUPPORT/HELP SILO COMPLETE (51 pages, rounds 59–64). ✅ GLOSSARY EXPANSION COMPLETE (24→46, round 65). BOTH founder-queued lanes (2026-06-18) DONE.
🟡 AWAITING FOUNDER on next lane. Remaining growth lanes (per ARCHITECTURE-TRUTH §7 / v4): more QuickBooks product/help (~86) · tools/calculators (~10, NEW type — needs proof) · guides (~16, t-guide) · blog (10, NEW article type — needs proof) · pricing children (5) · trust/reviews/partners/legal/careers children (HONESTY-GATED: reviews = 2 real Clutch only, no AggregateRating <5; case studies REAL-only/likely-flag) · switch pages (4, NEW) · /resources/research/ original-data layer (Gap 2 — flagged still-not-started, can't be backfilled) · more states/industries · the find-an-accountant national hub already built. Glossary could extend further (46→more) if desired.
⛔ FLIP-BLOCKER #6: all support (51) + glossary (22 new) pages join inferred-clean list (LIVE axe/overflow on founder's machine still pending before flip). CUTOVER GATE also needs: real Intuit badge artwork · baseline-vs-live-prod re-crawl · /resources/ repoint.
Support silo deferred (demand-gated): /quickbooks/support/<category>/* expansion buckets.
Generic intents added: qb-error (error pages) + qb-help (help-symptom pages). ps036 routes subscription/billing→Intuit; 9999=QBO browser. error-code template = clone 6123/h202/ps038; help-symptom = clone bank-feeds-not-working.
✅ ALL 5 STATES + CITY PARITY (55 city children). Founder chose (B) more depth; city lane DONE.
🟡 FOUNDER QUEUE (2026-06-18): (1) SUPPORT/HELP silo (~67) — IN PROGRESS, then (2) GLOSSARY expansion (24→~46).
⚑⚑ STOP — FOUNDER GLANCE PENDING on the support honest-triage PROOF before fan-out (round-59 report). Most reputation-sensitive type on the site.
SUPPORT SILO = honest-TRIAGE per v4 Sheet 7 (capture "QuickBooks support" demand by being the honest answer, route Intuit-account→Intuit, convert file/books→independent paid). Sheet-7 page rules ENFORCED: ATF disclosure · first FAQ "official support? No" · phone CTA "Talk to a Certified ProAdvisor (independent firm)" (added to ctaLexicon.json sanctioned) · no fabricated Intuit phone/hours/24-7 · provider=#organization · drop impersonation slugs · drop 24-7 (not staffed). Proof templates proven: support-triage (clone speak-to-a-quickbooks-expert) + error-code (clone h202) + help-symptom (clone h202 shape).
FAN-OUT AFTER GLANCE ≈ 47: ~16 error codes (6000/6000-83/6000-301/6073/6150/12002/12007/12029/15223/15271/9999/h101/h505/ps036/unrecoverable) · ~30 help-symptom (cant-login, data-recovery, file-wont-open, payroll-failed, reconciliation-broken, after-hours-help [honest hours], cant-reach-intuit, proadvisor-vs-intuit-support, etc.) · wire help/qb/error-codes hubs. NEW intents added: qb-support, qb-support-contact, qb-support-independent, qb-help-bank-feeds, qb-error-6123.
⛔ FLIP-BLOCKER #6: 5 support proof pages join inferred-clean list (LIVE axe/overflow pending).
IL wave-2 economies (distinct): Peoria=heavy-equip mfg+OSF healthcare+river · Champaign=UIUC Research Park tech/agtech · Bloomington=insurance+Rivian EV+ISU · Decatur=agribusiness processing · Schaumburg=suburban corporate-office+Woodfield retail.
⛔ FLIP-BLOCKER #6 grows: the 15 new TX/FL/IL cities join the inferred-clean list — LIVE axe/overflow on founder's machine still pending before flip.
TX wave-2 economies (distinct): Plano=corporate-HQ · Corpus Christi=energy-export/refining/port · Lubbock=cotton-agribusiness+Texas Tech · Laredo=#1 land-port trade corridor (deliberately differentiated from El Paso) · Killeen=Fort Cavazos military.
⛔ FLIP-BLOCKER #6 grows: these 5 TX cities join the inferred-clean list (static-proxy + byte-equivalence) — LIVE axe/overflow on founder's machine still pending before flip.
IL = pillar(re-linked) + 6 cities + cities-hub + 6 money + 6 QB spokes + 3 bkg + 4 tax/triage + industries(hub+6). Templates: city-child · state-service · state-triage · state-industry · pillar.
IL triage agency set = IDOR + City of Chicago Dept of Finance + IDES + IRS. biztax uses IL Secretary of State admin-dissolution (IL has NO $800 franchise tax).
⛔ FLIP-BLOCKER #6 GROWS: 27 new IL children this turn join the inferred-clean list (static-proxy + CA/TX/FL byte-equivalence) — LIVE axe/overflow on founder's machine still pending before flip.
IL industry angles (genuine): manufacturing=MM&E exemption · healthcare=insurance-AR+PPRT/PTE (books-only no PHI) · agency=Chicago 15% cloud tax+PPRT · restaurant=POS+tipped/FICA-tip-credit+10.25% Chicago (dining-tax general) · prof-services=IOLTA records-only · trucking=IFTA/IRP+intermodal nexus.
IL triage built on approved disclosure pattern; agency set = IDOR + City of Chicago Dept of Finance + IDES + IRS. biztax correctly uses IL Secretary of State admin-dissolution (NOT a $800 franchise tax — IL has none).
IL stack (pillar-verified): flat 4.95% income · PPRT (2.5% C-corp / 1.5% pass-through, even pass-throughs owe) · 9.5% combined C-corp · permanent PTE election (SB 1911) · 6.25%→10.25% Chicago sales · Chicago 15% cloud tax on SaaS · IDOR + Chicago Dept of Finance · 102 counties · 6th city = Springfield.
✅ FLORIDA COMPLETE (31 FL pages: pillar + 6 money + 6 QB + 3 bkg + 2 tax + industries hub+6 + cities hub+6, incl. triage), on the CORRECTED FL stack.
✅ FOUR STATES COMPLETE: NY · CA (39) · TX (32) · FL (31). NEXT = ILLINOIS depth (5th/last); build IL triage normally (approved pattern, IL Dept of Revenue + IRS). IL stack = flat 4.95% income + PPRT + Chicago taxes.
⚑ AFTER IL: flag breadth-vs-more-depth decision. ⚑ LESSON (rd-48): check each state's pillar tax facts BEFORE building children.
✅ FL ACCURACY CORRECTION COMPLETE (round 48, commits 7fe4c19 + this): the FL COMMERCIAL-RENT ("business rent")
sales tax was REPEALED effective Oct 1, 2025 (HB 7031). The ~18 FL pages built rounds 44/46/47 had wrongly
described it as current; ALL corrected site-wide (3 scripts in _build/scripts/fix-fl-commercial-rent*.py +
miami script + corporate-tax-help full rewrite). Replaced with the CURRENT FL-distinctive hook = SALES TAX ON
SERVICES (FL taxes commercial cleaning, pest control, repairs, security, laundry others exempt) + $5,000
single-item surtax cap + 5.5% C-corp ($50K exemption). Every remaining "commercial-rent" mention is now an
explicit REPEAL NOTE (corporate-tax-help educates on it; miami historical). Battery GREEN; grep-verified.
FL REMAINING = 6th city + cities-hub + pricing + pillar re-link → FLORIDA COMPLETE. Then IL.
✅ TRIAGE HOLD GATE CLEARED SITE-WIDE (founder approved CA disclosure pattern 2026-06-18; locked as approved). IL triage builds normally at IL.
✅ CALIFORNIA COMPLETE (39). ✅ TEXAS COMPLETE incl. triage (32). FLORIDA IN PROGRESS = pillar + 5 cities + 8 services (money 4/6 + speak ✅ [pricing pending] · tax 2/2 ✅ · bkg-spoke monthly ✅).
FL tax stack = no personal income tax BUT 5.5% C-corp · 6%+county-surtax sales tax · commercial-rent tax · TPP (DR-405) · RT-6 · FL Dept of Revenue · 67 counties.
⚑ TODO: re-link the 5 FL money pages' quickbooks-cleanup ref off the global to the FL QB-cleanup spoke when built (next FL wave).
⚑ APPROVED TRIAGE PATTERN: amber disclosure ATF · not-agency/not-CPA/no-rep/no-tax-advice/no-resolution · Intuit-intent routed away · CALL conversion. Replicate to IL (IL Dept of Revenue + IRS).
FOUR state child templates (city-child · state-service · state-triage · state-industry). PHASE = DEPTH (NY ✅ · CA ✅ · TX ✅ · FL/IL next).
⚑ FOUNDER GATE (2026-06-17): every state's triage pages (speak-to-a-proadvisor etc.) HELD pending CA-disclosure sign-off; all non-triage proceeds.
⚑ AFTER 5 DEEP: flag breadth-vs-more-depth decision (don't auto-spread to all 50).
⚑ FOUNDER SPOT-CHECK PENDING: the 3 CA honest-triage disclosures (state-tax-notice-help, business-tax-problems, speak-to-a-proadvisor).** Dev server: `npm run serve` → http://192.168.1.7:8080/
(data-file edits need a server restart; a clean `npx @11ty/eleventy` reflects them). PROBE via 127.0.0.1 (8125 =
_site-prod, 8090 = _site + axe.min.js) — the probe scripts' hardcoded `localhost` resolves to IPv6 → empty output.
**⚠ HEADLESS-CHROME PROBES NON-FUNCTIONAL THIS MACHINE** — `chrome --headless=new --dump-dom` returns 0-length DOM
even on `127.0.0.1` directly (not the localhost/IPv6 quirk; genuine chrome stall, see chrome-headless-leak memory).
axe/overflow verified instead via **static proxy** (heading-order/alt/long-token parse) + **byte-equivalence to the
axe-0/27 founder-approved SF page** (identical components/chrome). Run live axe_page.ps1/overflow_probe.ps1 on the
founder's own machine to confirm. **NEVER `Get-Process chrome | Stop-Process`** (round-21 rule) — use kill_probe.ps1 only.

**CITY-CHILD ARCHITECTURE (round 29, RS8 one-source — like glossary):** every city child = a one-line `.njk`
(`{% include "partials/city-child-body.njk" %}`) + a rich `.11tydata.js`. Shared body
`src/_includes/partials/city-child-body.njk` (DOM proven-equivalent to the approved SF proof; IDs from `slug`,
headings from `cityName`, section eyebrows from `copy.*`). Shared schema helper `_build/lib/city-child.js` assembles
WebPage+BreadcrumbList+Service+FAQPage+speakable from `data.cityMeta`. SF left as its own standalone pair (approved,
untouched). **Add a city = 1 data file + 1 one-line njk + a build-new-queue.json entry.** Reuse for ALL states.

**DONE this phase:** ✅ GLOSSARY COMPLETE (24 terms + index; DefinedTerm/speakable/CALL; real-or-skip held) ·
✅ find-an-accountant national HUB built + RE-COMPOSED (elevated 50-state router: pick-your-state selector +
buyer-card state grid + premium numbered process + deliver-card network + by-need silo routing) + the interim
`/find-an-accountant/ → /accounting/` 301 PULLED (resolves to itself) · ✅ CA **San Francisco** child PROOF
(`/find-an-accountant/california/cities/san-francisco/`) built + **founder-APPROVED** (localization confirmed
genuinely SF-specific) · ✅ site-wide UX locked (link-TYPE underlines + animated arrow, elevated in-brief,
hero+intro width = --measure-prose, triage amber disclosure, standing rules R8 UX-one-source + R9 count-line) ·
✅ **CA CITIES WAVE 1 (round 29, 5 children: LA · San Diego · San Jose · Sacramento · Oakland)** — each a distinct
city-tax mechanism (mad-libs FAILS): LA gross-receipts LABT+Measure ULA · SD employee-certificate (no GR tax) ·
SJ per-employee · Sacramento gross-receipts BOT + capital econ · Oakland progressive Measure T + cannabis §280E.
Built on the new shared city-child architecture; battery GREEN; honesty held (deferred to authorities/CPA,
founder-name-zero). Detail: `_build/reports/round-29-ca-cities-w1.md`. ·
✅ **CA CITIES WAVE 2 (round 30, 5 children: Fresno · Long Beach · Anaheim · Riverside · Bakersfield)** — Fresno
ag sales-tax exemptions · Long Beach own-city-tax (NOT LA's) + Port logistics · Anaheim TOT-as-liability/tourism ·
Riverside Inland-Empire distribution + multi-state nexus · Bakersfield oil & gas JIB/royalty/LOS + Kern ag.
Battery GREEN; honesty held. Detail: `_build/reports/round-30-ca-cities-w2.md`. **CA cities = 11 total.** ·
✅ **TX CITIES WAVE 1 (round 31, 5 children: Houston · Dallas · Austin · San Antonio · Fort Worth)** — NEW STATE.
TX has no income tax + no city gross-receipts taxes, so differentiation is ECONOMIC (mad-libs still fails):
Houston oil&gas/Port/medical · Dallas corporate/finance/tech multi-entity · Austin SaaS/chips/music · San Antonio
military/cyber/tourism · Fort Worth Barnett-gas/aerospace/ranching. Shared TX tax stack (no income tax → franchise
"margin" tax → 8.25% sales tax) + a varied 3rd tax item per city (severance/BPP/HOT). The shared city-child template
is state-agnostic (new state = data files only). Battery GREEN; honesty held (deferred to TX Comptroller/cities/CPA).
Detail: `_build/reports/round-31-tx-cities-w1.md`. **City children now = 16 (11 CA + 5 TX).** ·
✅ **FL CITIES WAVE 1 (round 32, 5 children: Miami · Orlando · Tampa · Jacksonville · Fort Lauderdale)** — NEW STATE.
FL = no personal income tax BUT 5.5% C-corp income tax (distinct from TX); Florida DOR. Per-city distinctness via
economy + a different FL-specific tax item each: Miami commercial-rent sales tax · Orlando Tourist Development Tax ·
Tampa tangible-personal-property (DR-405) · Jacksonville reemployment (RT-6) tax · Fort Lauderdale boat sales-tax cap.
Battery GREEN; honesty held (deferred to FL DOR/county/CPA). Detail: `_build/reports/round-32-fl-cities-w1.md`.
**City children now = 21 (11 CA + 5 TX + 5 FL).** ·
✅ **IL CITIES WAVE 1 (round 33, 5 children: Chicago · Aurora · Naperville · Joliet · Rockford)** — NEW STATE,
completes CA/TX/FL/IL. IL = flat 4.95%/7% income tax + the IL-unique Personal Property Replacement Tax (hits
pass-throughs) + Chicago's local stack. Chicago = lease transaction tax on SaaS/cloud + amusement tax on
streaming + 10.25% sales; Aurora/Rockford = manufacturing machinery exemption; Naperville = high property tax;
Joliet = intermodal logistics + multi-state nexus. Battery GREEN; honesty held (deferred to IDOR/Chicago Dept
of Finance/CPA). Detail: `_build/reports/round-33-il-cities-w1.md`. **City children now = 26 (11 CA + 5 TX + 5 FL + 5 IL).**
**⛔ FLIP-BLOCKER (cutover gate #6): 26 city children + 24 glossary = 50 pages are inferred-clean (static-proxy +

## 🏗️ DEPTH BUILD-OUT (founder 2026-06-17) — fully build NY/CA/TX/FL/IL per v4 BEFORE any new states
Scope from v4 Sheet 2 (LOCATIONS). Per full state = **Pillar + Money(6) + QB-spokes(6) + Bookkeeping-spokes(3)
+ Tax-cluster(varies) + Industries(hub+6 state-weighted) + Cities(hub+N)**. v4 RULES: industries = only the
6 state-weighted (rest → global /accounting/industries/*); advisory/comparisons/payroll → global; NO /near-me/;
children-on-pillar (re-link each pillar's ecosystem block to children once built). State service+industry
children = **t-bofu** (shared templates: `partials/state-service-body.njk` ✅ built round 34; state-industry
body = TODO). NY = master, DONE (39). Remaining ≈ **CA 22 · TX 26 · FL 26 · IL 27**. Order: **CA → TX → FL → IL**.
- **v4 state-weighted INDUSTRIES:** CA = ecommerce·agency·restaurant·real-estate·professional-services·construction
  · TX = construction·manufacturing·real-estate·trucking·healthcare·professional-services · FL = restaurant·
  healthcare·dental·real-estate·construction·home-services · IL = manufacturing·healthcare·agency·restaurant·
  professional-services·trucking.
- **v4 TAX cluster:** CA 4 (sales-tax·ab5-worker-classification·state-tax-notice·business-tax) · TX 2 (sales-tax·
  franchise-tax) · FL 2 (sales-tax·business-tax) · IL 3 (sales-tax·state-tax-notice·business-tax).
- **Missing cities to add:** TX el-paso · FL st-petersburg · IL springfield. (CA cities = 11, ahead of v4's 8;
  founder-ruled: keep anaheim, skip a separate orange-county page.)
- **CA progress:** pillar ✅ · 11 cities ✅ · **15 services ✅** (round 34 money/bkg ×5; round 35 QB-spokes ×6;
  round 36 tax-cluster ×4: sales-tax-help, ab5-worker-classification, state-tax-notice-help [triage],
  business-tax-problems [triage]). CA remaining: **pricing + speak-to-a-proadvisor (2 special)** ·
  **industries hub+6** · **cities-hub** · pillar ecosystem re-link.
- **NEW shared templates:** `partials/state-triage-body.njk` (round 36, honest-triage; amber disclosure ATF +
  scope-split, Sheet-7/§8) + `partials/state-industry-body.njk` (round 37, t-location industry child).
  State templates now: city-child-body · state-service-body · state-triage-body · state-industry-body.
- **CA industries ✅ (round 37):** hub + 6 (ecommerce, agency, restaurant, real-estate, professional-services,
  construction), each CA×industry-localized. **CA remaining ≈ 5:** cleanup-bookkeeping + urgent-bookkeeping
  (bkg spokes), speak-to-a-proadvisor (triage) + pricing (table) [money cluster's last 2], cities-hub, pillar re-link.
- **TODO re-link:** quickbooks-cleanup CTA re-pointed to the CA child ✅ (round 35); `sales-tax-help` links still
  point to global /accounting/sales-tax-compliance/ until the CA tax-cluster wave ships — re-point then.
✅ **ROUND 34 — CA SERVICE CLUSTER WAVE 1** (5 money/bkg pages + new shared state-service template). Battery GREEN.
  Detail: `_build/reports/round-34-ca-services-w1.md`.
✅ **ROUND 35 — CA QB-SPOKES** (6 pages: setup, cleanup, reconciliation, migration, training, error-fixes). Each
  genuinely service-distinct + CA-specific. Battery GREEN; honesty held. Detail: `_build/reports/round-35-ca-qbspokes.md`.
✅ **ROUND 36 — CA TAX-CLUSTER** (4 pages: sales-tax-help, ab5-worker-classification + 2 HONEST-TRIAGE:
  state-tax-notice-help, business-tax-problems) + new state-triage template. Battery GREEN; founder-zero PASS.
  **⚑ FOUNDER SPOT-CHECK PENDING on the 2 triage disclosures + AB5 (R3 — honest-triage gets its own review).**
  Disclosures defer all filing/agency/resolution/representation to CPA/EA/attorney; not-Intuit; educational-only;
  no tax-resolution/OIC claims. Detail: `_build/reports/round-36-ca-taxcluster.md`.
✅ **ROUND 37 — CA INDUSTRIES** (6 children + hub + new state-industry template): ecommerce, agency, restaurant,
  real-estate, professional-services, construction. Each CA×industry (district-tax-by-ship-to, ASC 606, uncapped
  SDI, Prop 13, IOLTA, CA prevailing wage, AB5). Trust-fund boundaries explicit (we keep records, don't hold funds).
  Battery GREEN; founder-zero PASS. Detail: `_build/reports/round-37-ca-industries.md`.
✅ **ROUND 38 — CA BKG-SPOKES + CITIES-HUB** (cleanup-bookkeeping, urgent-bookkeeping + cities-hub). cleanup =
  behind-books catch-up (distinct from QB-spoke quickbooks-cleanup); urgent = deadline-driven (honest, no false
  urgency). cities-hub = t-location, ItemList of the 11 city children. Battery GREEN. Detail: `round-38-ca-bkgspokes-citieshub.md`.
✅ **ROUND 39 — CALIFORNIA COMPLETE** (speak-to-a-proadvisor [bespoke not-Intuit honest-triage] + pricing [bespoke
  fixed-fee table, canonical figures] + the v4 children-on-pillar PILLAR ECOSYSTEM RE-LINK — the CA pillar's 6
  clusters now link every label to its built child). **CA is the first state fully built to v4 depth (39 pages).**
  Battery GREEN. Detail: `_build/reports/round-39-ca-complete.md`. **NEXT = TEXAS depth (data files only on the 4 templates).**

**▶ NEXT — FAN OUT THE STATE CLUSTER, FULLY AUTONOMOUS, ALL 50 STATES CONTINUOUSLY:**
order = **CA cities + industries → TX → FL → IL → then the remaining states.** Patterns PROVEN, reuse them:
- **CITY child** = `layout: t-location` + `heroLight: true` (lighter city-child hero, the locked standard). Mirror
  `src/find-an-accountant/california/cities/san-francisco.{njk,11tydata.js}` (the approved template): sections =
  summary · ai-summary (5 Q) · LOCAL CONTEXT (the un-clonable band) · areas · tax stack (grid-3) · industries
  (→ real `/accounting/industries/*` pages) · services (→ real `/accounting/*` + `/quickbooks/*` silo pages) ·
  advisory · expert review · 8 FAQ. Schema: WebPage + BreadcrumbList + Service + FAQPage + speakable; reviewedBy
  `#david-westgate`. Breadcrumb Home / Find an Accountant / <State> / <City> (skip a Cities crumb — no cities hub).
- **INDUSTRY child** = same tier, industry×state localized.
- **HARD BAR — REAL local substance per page:** actual city/state tax facts + real local economy; the **mad-libs
  test MUST fail** (swap the place name → it reads false). A page that can't carry genuine distinct substance →
  **SKIP or flag, never ship thin/templated** (Google suppresses thin local pages). Top-0.01%: speakable + rich
  schema + CALL conversion, elevated system, mobile clean.
- **HONESTY HARD-GATE:** real facts only; defer nexus/filing/return specifics to the CPA/EA (as on sales-tax-nexus
  + SF); founder-name-zero; never imply Intuit affiliation; NO fabricated stats/counts/clients/reviews.
- **Per page:** register the URL in `_build/build-new-queue.json`; new CTA intents → `src/_data/intents.json`;
  new CTA labels → `src/_data/ctaLexicon.json`; every link must resolve (links gate). Build → battery GREEN →
  overflow 360/390/768 + axe on a sample of the wave → commit per wave → round report + COUNT + URLs.
- **After the state cluster** (growth order): support silo → more-QB → tools (NEW type — prove first) → guides →
  pricing + blog → trust/reviews/etc. (reviews HONESTY-GATED: only 2 real Clutch reviews; no AggregateRating <5).

**OPEN for flip (NOT blocking growth; flip is LAST after growth + founder sign-off):** form POST handler
(Cloudflare Pages Function — forms POST to /contact/submit + /api/pillar-lead, no handler in repo yet) · per-type
OG images (base head has no og:image) · real Intuit ProAdvisor badge artwork (FOUNDER supplies) · full
baseline-vs-prod re-crawl.

**(↓ historical log — SUPERSEDED by the block above; kept for context ↓)**
**MODE was AUTONOMOUS (round 28).** Original 5 STOP-GATES + re-skin detail below are historical.

**DONE (elevated re-skin):** token+font re-cut · money-page proof (/accounting/bookkeeping/cleanup-bookkeeping/)
· home · global chrome (mid-mega nav + light footer + nowrap) · premium numbered process · variety gate
(variety-12a, 40 legacy exempted in variety-exceptions.json) · **hub proof + FANNED OUT (9 t-hub pages)** ·
visual polish (cold nav, breadcrumb, prose links, related-cards) · **Q&A split** (bookkeeping children 10→5 via
`override:aiSummary`; /vs/ inspected = NOT the bug, 2 intentional blocks) · **endpoint type** (contact +
file-review + 404 share `partials/util-hero.njk`; ai-summary + numbered-process + breadcrumb stripped; form
centerpiece) · **NAV-SCOPE fix** (t-bofu no longer forces chrome:minimal → FULL mega-nav everywhere; MINIMAL
nav ONLY on /contact/ + /file-review/; 16 wrong pages fixed; 404 now full). Phone CLEARED (real 877 number).

**⚑ CONTACT corrections APPLIED this turn (verify on resume):** (a) contact hero is LEFT-aligned
(`heroAlign: left` → `.util-hero--left`); 404/file-review stay centered. (b) the BRIEF/TL;DR block is RETAINED
(#contact-promise "How to reach us & what to expect"); only the 5-Q AI Q&A + numbered process + breadcrumb
were stripped. Form stays centerpiece below the hero.

**✅ GUIDE PROOF DONE (`792ba59`, 2026-06-17) — `/quickbooks/faq/`.** t-guide layout gained an OPT-IN split
article-hero + signature figure (`heroFigure`, DEFAULT OFF — fit-to-purpose). NEW token-only components from
the locked Guide template: `.diagram-feature` (carded in-article diagram; partial `figure-reconcile-flow.svg`
in cluster-fixing) + `.lead-magnet` (one dark mid-article offer; HONEST → real free file review, NOT a
fabricated PDF, per R5). faq: equity GREEN (26h·35faq·26schema) · axe 0/27 · overflow clean 360/390/768 · CLS 0
· CSS 75,939B/83,968B. Full detail: round-28-wave1.md.
**✅ LINK UNDERLINE — single site-wide source (`5c07840`, founder directive 2026-06-17).** All text-link
underlines unified to the buyer-card look (short PARTIAL rule default → FULL on hover/focus; faint ink →
accent, 1.5px). ONE source = the `LINK UNDERLINE — SINGLE SITE-WIDE SOURCE` block in `09-extensions.css`
(background-gradient, works on wrapping prose links — a `::after` pseudo can't). Covers prose/inline,
Explore→ card links, heading-links, footer, breadcrumb, TOC. **NAV kept pill-hover (captured chrome) — JUDGMENT
CALL, awaiting a 5-sec founder confirm.** axe /quickbooks/ 0/28.

**✅ BREADCRUMBS site-wide except /contact/ (`0beee05`).** t-hub + util-hero now render breadcrumbs; 8 hubs +
file-review + 404 covered; contact omits (founder); HOME (`/`) left without (root — single-item crumb is
meaningless; FLAGGED). **✅ NAV underline (`0beee05`):** `.nav__link` adopts the partial→full underline (exact
buyer-card `::after` pseudo; pill dropped on plain links; triggers keep chevron+pill). **✅ GUIDE FAN-OUT,
reference sub-type (`bd23320`):** elevated split hero + T-account figure + trust on the 6 reference FAQ guides
(/accounting/faq, /accounting/advisory/faq, /accounting/bookkeeping/faq, /accounting/industries/faq,
/quickbooks/payroll/faq, /partners/faq). Error/legal/HowTo guides KEEP fit-to-purpose heroes. All equity GREEN,
overflow clean, axe 0, CSS 76,515B/83,968B.

**✅ STOP-GATE #1 PROVED (`d72642d`, 2026-06-17) — NY pillar + 1 NY child elevated.** Per the locked State
Pillar template, the elevated state-pillar hero = LIGHT split article-hero + T-account figure + trust chips
(the legacy dark state-contour hero was a migration-floor invention, now retired for the pillar). t-location
gained a `heroFigure` opt-in (default OFF). `/find-an-accountant/new-york/` (72h·17faq·30schema, axe 0/36) +
`/find-an-accountant/new-york/cities/new-york-city/` (21h·8faq·27schema, axe 0/29) lead on it; both overflow
clean 360/390/768, CLS 0, equity GREEN. CA/TX/FL/IL landings + the other 37 NY children KEEP the dark hero
until fan-out. **⏸ AWAITING FOUNDER REVIEW of this proof before fanning out NY children.**

**✅ NY CHILDREN FAN-OUT DONE (`5c9e8db`, 2026-06-17).** All 37 remaining NY children elevated to the split hero
+ T-account figure + trust (11 cities + cities-hub, 8 industries + industries-hub, 13 service children, 4
honest-triage) via idempotent `_build/scripts/ny_children_elevate.py` (front-matter add only). Whole NY tree
(pillar + 38 children) now wears the elevated state hero. equity GREEN site-wide · battery green · overflow clean
360/390/768 · axe 0 (spot-checked city/industry/service) · CSS 76,515B. **Honest-triage COPY untouched** (hero
re-skin only) — STOP-GATE #2 not crossed.

**✅ STATE LANDINGS DONE (`209768b`, 2026-06-17).** CA/TX/FL/IL elevated to the same split hero + T-account
figure + state-tailored trust (legacy dark neutral-motif hero retired for them; `heroMotif` left unused/harmless).
equity GREEN · battery green · overflow clean 360/390/768 · axe 0/36 (TX spot-check) · CLS 0 · CSS 76,515B.
**▶ The ENTIRE find-an-accountant silo (43: NY pillar + 38 NY children + 4 state landings) now wears the elevated
state hero.**

**✅ HEROES CAPPED AT 2 CTAs (`9aee383`, founder 2026-06-17).** Enforced in every layout hero loop via
`hero.actions.slice(0,2)` (t-hub/t-mofu/t-bofu/t-guide/t-location + util-hero) — site-wide, future-proof; the
redundant 3rd CTA (usually the tel, covered by header + call-bar) dropped. ctaBand unaffected. Verified exactly
2 hero CTAs across samples; kept pairs sensible (primary + ghost).
**✅ TIER RE-TAG DONE (`e134674`).** 13 NY service + 4 honest-triage children t-location→t-bofu via
`_build/scripts/ny_retier_bofu.py` (layout + section--tier-hub→bofu + bodyClass page--bofu). data-tier=bofu
confirmed; cities/industries stay location. design-fidelity PASS (bofu via proof-strip/intake-form/hero-figure),
equity GREEN, overflow clean, axe 0/29. **Honest-triage compliance copy UNTOUCHED** (copy-based disclosure in
hero subheading + scope-split section — verified intact; STOP-GATE #2 preserved).
**⚠ Housekeeping:** an empty commit `c5b78d1` titled "_" slipped between the two (no tree impact; squash later).

**✅ WAVE-2 ASSESSMENT (2026-06-17, against Gallery 06 per-type heroes + captured templates).** Verified each
Wave-2 type's hero against the captured design. Result: **most are ALREADY fit-to-type** from the skin re-cut +
migration bodies — no uniform figure-hero applies (Gallery 06: "each type gets a first screen fit to its job").
- **legal** ✅ DONE — document treatment already in place (`.legal-doc` header: eyebrow "Legal" + title +
  Effective/Updated dates; NO marketing hero, NO cta-band). Matches Gallery 06 legal spec exactly.
- **product/mofu** ✅ FIT — compact hero + body (vs-table/buyer-card/CALL). Gallery 06 mofu = compact + small
  "diagram tease" (optional enhancement, not a gap).
- **comparison/vs** ✅ FIT — compact hero + vs-table verdict (Gallery 06 = "honest verdict" table). 
- **pricing** ✅ FIT — t-bofu compact hero + real fixed-fee tier tables + CallBand (Gallery 06 = "transparency →
  CallBand"). Optional: the 3 featured tier tiles in-hero (enhancement, not a gap).
- **location-child** ⚠ **CONFLICT — FOUNDER DECISION NEEDED.** Gallery 06 says location child = "lighter — NOT
  the pillar hero" (the A4 fix, flagged RED in the capture). But the NY-children fan-out (`5c9e8db`, founder-OK'd)
  gave the 11 cities + 8 industries (+ NYC child) the PILLAR's figure-split hero — re-introducing the A4 clone.
  Fixing to the capture needs a NEW light-compact location-child hero variant (no figure, no dark contour, distinct
  from pillar) + re-applying to 19–20 pages → STOP-GATE #5 (structure decision). **Recommend:** build the lighter
  child hero per the capture; keep the figure on the pillar + the (now t-bofu) service children (money-page
  treatment is capture-correct for bofu). Awaiting founder ruling — did NOT unilaterally flip just-approved pages.

**✅ LOCATION-CHILD LIGHTER HERO (`71d98b1`, founder ruling 2026-06-17).** A4 fix: cities + industries no longer
clone the pillar. New t-location `heroLight` branch = lighter compact conversion hero (eyebrow+heading+lede+2 CTAs
+trust, NO figure/contour/motif), subordinate to the pillar. Applied to all 19 city+industry leaf pages via
`ny_children_lighten.py`. Pillar keeps figure; t-bofu service children keep theirs. equity GREEN · battery green ·
overflow clean 360/390/768 · axe 0/27. (Sub-hubs cities.njk/industries.njk still figure — leave or lighten later.)

**✅ STOP-GATE #2 CLEARED + TRIAGE FANNED OUT (`d55bc0b`, founder OK 2026-06-17).** All 5 triage pages carry the
amber `.disclosure--warn` ATF banner (not-Intuit/route-to-Intuit or not-CPA/EA/tax-authority, reusing established
copy — no new claims); the 4 NY triage lightened to the compact triage hero + a call-breakout CALL conversion.
**✅ LINK-TYPE UX SYSTEM + ANIMATED ARROW (`<this round>`).** Two logical link types, ONE source (09-extensions +
04-chrome): ACTION/CONTACT (prose/content/footer-email) = partial→full on hover/focus/active/current; NAV/LIST
(footer cols + utility + breadcrumb + TOC + primary nav) = clean rest → rule on hover/focus/current. Animated
`.lnk-arrow` (118 trailing arrows wrapped site-wide via `wrap_link_arrows.py`). axe 0v/28p, reduced-motion safe,
WCAG focus intact. **✅ RE-SKIN ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE — 142/142 built pages on the elevated system.**

**(historical) STOP-GATE #2 — HONEST-TRIAGE PROOF (`52de277`) — was awaiting OK; now cleared above.**
`/quickbooks/speak-to-a-quickbooks-expert/` now carries the captured amber disclosure ATF banner (`.disclosure--warn`,
--caution-* tokens, warning icon) — the unmissable not-Intuit + route-billing/login-to-Intuit signal. Compliance COPY
kept verbatim (thorough round-26 founder-approved disclosure). equity GREEN (36h/7faq/27schema) · axe 0/31 (amber AA)
· battery green. **FOUNDER: verify the disclosure copy, then OK the triage fan-out.**

**▶ NEXT (after triage OK) — FULLY AUTONOMOUS toward 200 (founder 2026-06-17):** triage fan-out (amber disclosure
+ lighten the 4 NY triage heroes per capture's compact triage hero) → rest of Wave-2 optional enhancements →
find-an-accountant LAST → toward 200. Hold hard gates (honesty/equity/variety/forms, equity-GREEN every page).
Update tracker + round report with every URL each turn. ONLY STOP for the triage gate (now). CUTOVER GATE tracked
above; gate #1 (phone) CLEARED. Old→handoff map + RS1–RS4 + PACE govern.
**DEV-SERVER NOTE:** `npm run serve` binds the LAN; this session = http://192.168.1.7:8080/. Probe servers
must be hit via 127.0.0.1 (the scripts' hardcoded `localhost` resolves to IPv6 ::1 while python http.server

**🟢 CODE PHASE LIVE — design captured, re-skin underway (2026-06-16).** Founder fetched the Claude
Design "TechBrot Design System Elevation" handoff; we are in PURE IMPLEMENTATION per it (design-ownership
rule). Locked design source: `_build/design-capture/extracted/`. Full plan + execution log:

  honesty rules · section-variety engine (#12a–d) · forms ONLY on /contact/ + /file-review/ + minimal pillar.
- **⚠ Recorded finding:** the handoff bundle ships TWO directions; the `_ds/` snapshot (cobalt + Geist-only)
  is an EARLIER iteration, **intentionally SUPERSEDED**. Capture from the templates + galleries + handoff.
- **✅ COMMIT 1 — token + font re-cut (`a2be13b`, pushed):** 00-fonts (Geist + Geist Mono self-hosted, retire
  Public Sans/IBM Plex; Fraunces kept) · 01-tokens (full cold/light re-cut, all enforced names preserved so

- **✅ COMMIT 2 — PROVEN MONEY PAGE (`73c5d54`, pushed) — STOP at founder review gate.**
  `/accounting/bookkeeping/cleanup-bookkeeping/` re-skinned end-to-end on the elevated system. RESTYLE ONLY:
  `.11tydata.js` untouched (all content + full schema graph preserved); every baseline heading + 12 FAQ +

- **⚙ EXECUTION-PATH DECISION (founder 2026-06-16): upgrade the current cobalt CSS to premium WITH CODE** (no
  separate Claude Design round). Plan = **`PREMIUM-UPGRADE-PLAN.md`** (DRAFT, awaiting founder review): honest
  audit (foundation strong; gaps = warm→cold/ink-blue palette re-cut, the SECTION-LAYOUT engine that fixes
  same-looking sections, the signature ledger-diagram + icon system, CallBand-primary, premium components, nav
  mid-mega + footer accordion, section-aware motion; pipeline lock so `src/assets/css` is authoritative). Gated

  §13.3 + the §2/A re-tiering + the §13.9/variety gate → prove the ~11 proving-set types → founder sign-off →
  re-pattern the rest wave-by-wave → **CUTOVER (LAST)**. ARCHITECTURE-TRUTH ✅ re-approved + D1 re-tier queue ✅ GO.
  **NOT building yet — plan review is next.**

  ✅ added** (§8/§6 + gate §13.9 #12d: each type wears ITS hero; legal = clean authoritative doc, no marketing hero).
- The tier RE-TIERING pass (NY ~17 conversion children → t-bofu, FINAL-MIGRATION-REPORT Section A; accounting
  BOFU services → t-bofu, Section D2) runs INSIDE the redesign phase — BEFORE cutover, not after.

**STANDING (founder, 2026-06-15):** commit+push after EVERY wave (never batch waves uncommitted); keep
BUILD-TRACKER + `_build/reports/FINAL-MIGRATION-REPORT.md` + `round-26-ny-children.md` current so a fresh
session can read them + the last commit and continue from the last committed wave.

### ⚠️ POST-MIGRATION REVIEW (founder-requested 2026-06-15) — TIER RE-CATEGORIZATION
Founder directive: the 38 NY children were ALL built on **t-location** (build-to-floor, one proven tier
for speed). That is architecturally wrong for the **conversion/BOFU** children, which are flat location
clones today but should be **t-bofu** (proof-strip + intake-form + vs-table conversion structure), not
location landings. The pillar `/find-an-accountant/new-york/` is the ONLY page that should carry the
t-location hero (state-contour motif + sticky call-bar location chrome).
- **Verify post-migration:** only the NY PILLAR carries the t-location hero; the cities (11) + cities-hub
  + industries (8) + industries-hub are legitimately location/MOFU and may stay t-location; but the
  SERVICE + HONEST-TRIAGE children are BOFU and likely need re-tiering to t-bofu.
- **Founder-named t-bofu candidates:** cleanup-bookkeeping, monthly-bookkeeping, urgent-bookkeeping,
  business-tax-problems, quickbooks-cleanup.
- **Deliverable:** the FINAL MIGRATION REPORT must list, with full URLs, every NY child that may need
  re-tiering (location-clone → t-bofu), for founder review AFTER migration completes. Do NOT re-tier now
  — finish the migration first; this is a post-cutover-prep cleanup pass.
- **Same care on ACCOUNTING (39):** as each accounting page is migrated, note in the final report any
  industry/service page that is really **BOFU** (conversion: cleanup, catch-up, a specific paid service)
  vs **MOFU** (consideration: hub, overview, comparison) so the tier choice is flagged, not assumed.
This re-tiering pass is tracked here so it is not lost; it runs after the 139-baseline cutover-parity gate.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · NEW PHASE — PATH B MIGRATION. **✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-15 (139/139). This block is
historical planning; the live status is the POST-MIGRATION GOVERNING RULE block above.** Goal (as run):
migrate the 104 remaining baselines to the current cobalt system FAST (build-to-FLOOR, not polish — all get
re-patterned on the new design system in the redesign phase), reach all-139-baselines parity. ~~then
cutover, THEN design reset~~ → **SEQUENCE CORRECTED 2026-06-15: redesign happens BEFORE cutover; cutover is
the LAST step (nothing goes live until the redesign is signed off).** 200 was NOT a target; the gate was
"all 139 baselines migrated" — MET. Floor per page (all met): equity GREEN · axe 0 · overflow clean ·
correct tier + CTA · honest-triage where it applies · design-fidelity per-tier pass.
**MANDATORY: maintain `_build/reports/PAGE-TYPE-REGISTRY.md`** (every page tagged to type/tier
+ exact section list per type, incl. not-yet-built types) — it is the input to the design reset
and must be complete by cutover.
**MIGRATION ORDER (proposed):** silo 1 quickbooks (16) → silo 2 vs (5) → silo 3 accounting
(39) → silo 4 partners (1) → silo 5 find-an-accountant (43, needs t-location). Hubs before
children (no internal 404s); ranking-value weighted; the cross-linked /quickbooks/proadvisor-team/
+ /speak-to-a-quickbooks-expert/ are dependency-priority (already linked from shipped pages →
currently broken on the new build). find-an-accountant last (orphan/lowest indexed + new tier).
**Silo-1 batch-1 = proof page /quickbooks/desktop/ (t-mofu) — DONE + verified.** Migrated from
the 1638-line static baseline: 48 baseline headings + 8 FAQ + 28 schema types all preserved
(content-equity GREEN), CollectionPage/BreadcrumbList/ItemList/FAQPage schema kept, ItemList-of-4
editions carried AS a vs-table, byline-block + buyer-card + meta-reviewed, file-review-primary CTA,
honest QBD-sunset framing. Added `quickbooks-desktop` intent. axe 0 · overflow clean 360/390/768 ·
LH CLS 0, a11y/BP/SEO 100. Recipe + registry entry ("t-mofu product page") established → replicate
the rest of silo 1 on founder sign-off (enterprise/which-plan/proadvisor-team t-mofu next; then
migration+payroll children; speak-to-expert honest-triage). STOP per batch (preview review).
**`DESIGN-DIRECTION.md` created** (standalone creative brief for the post-cutover design reset:
colder/lighter palette, richest fonts, mega-menu + per-type navbars, 3D/SVG/imagery where they
earn it, best-in-niche ATF, mid-body CTAs, unique-hero-per-type + shared-mid-component library).
Registry Part-3 tiers flagged **PROPOSED, not decided** (founder rules tiers on preview; #5 open).
HELD: #4 research-log N=0 · #5 the-9 t-bofu/t-mofu decided on preview · #2 footer WCAG queued.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · ROUND 21 DESIGN-FIDELITY DEBT **FULLY CLEARED** — /about/methodology/
+ /trust/ (the last 2 generic-primitive pages) re-patterned to their tier (both t-mofu).
Each got mofu's by-rule signatures per PLACEMENT-MAP: `byline-block` at the top of the
article (renders "By the Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor team" — founder-name-zero holds) +
`meta-reviewed` at the foot of the page-review section + one `pull-quote` elevating an
existing thesis line (methodology: "The process is the product…"; trust: "A real review
program is worth more than a hundred fabricated stars."). Also dropped the `review-card`
MISUSE on both (standards/boundaries/navCards on methodology; certifications/scope/related
on trust — review-card is "—" for mofu) to `stack-8`, consistent with the error/hub/bofu
re-patterns. Equity preserved (all baseline headings kept through the conversion;
content-equity GREEN — methodology 34 headings, trust 39). **GATE NOW: 32 content pages pass
per-tier on merit · DEBT LIST EMPTY.** Re-verify: battery GREEN · overflow 2/2 clean
360/390/768 · axe 2/2 zero violations · LH both **CLS 0**, a11y/BP/SEO 100.
**NEXT:** founder review on preview; the QB-remainder (desktop/enterprise/consulting/
proadvisor-team/which-plan) on the approved fidelity patterns; the footer target-size
(WCAG 2.2) chrome fix when the footer is finalized; research-log N=0 pending founder seed.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · ROUND 21 BOFU DEBT CLEARED — the 9 mis-tiered t-bofu pages
re-patterned to BOFU signatures (proof-strip + full intake-form), founder-ordered.
Each of fractional-cfo · catch-up/cleanup/monthly bookkeeping · sales-tax · qb
cleanup/migration/payroll/setup got: (1) a `proof-strip` as the first body section
(firm-level facts — 4&times; Certified ProAdvisor · fixed-fee · 1-business-day · the 2
verified Clutch reviews [only review proof] · one honest per-page specialty line), and
(2) the shared `intake-form.njk` partial in a conversion section before the FAQ, with
per-page params (intent = each page's canonical intent; source_type bofu-conversion;
submit "Send the Discovery Brief"). **Honesty note:** did NOT copy payroll-management's
"checked by default" intake note — the JS only auto-checks a service when the page is
loaded with `?intent=` in the URL (applyIntent reads the query string, not the hidden
default), so a direct visitor sees nothing pre-checked; used truthful non-asserting notes
instead. **(payroll-management's own note should be reconciled — flagged to founder.)**
Existing buyer-card/vs-table/pull-quote left in place (open question whether conversion
pages should route/compare at all, or are really t-mofu — deferred to founder; not
blocking). Equity preserved (structural-add only, zero data-file edits; new H2s are
additive). **Gate now: 30 pass per-tier on merit · 2 DEBT** (only /about/methodology/ +
/trust/). Re-verify: battery GREEN · overflow 9/9 clean 360/390/768 · axe 9/9 zero
violations · LH catch-up+setup **CLS 0**, BP/SEO 100. New probe scripts: overflow_bofu.ps1
· axe_bofu.ps1.
**CHROME TODO (NEW, site-wide — flagged, not fixed):** Lighthouse `target-size` (WCAG 2.2)
fails on EVERY full-footer page — the footer `mailto:info@techbrot.com` + `tel:` links are
spaced/sized under 24px on mobile (a11y 96-97). Pre-existing chrome, not a regression;
fix = footer contact-link tap-target padding when the footer is finalized (footer is
already a tracked chrome TODO). axe missed it (it ran WCAG 2.0/2.1, not 2.2).
**NEXT:** founder reviewing patterns on preview; then /about/methodology/ + /trust/ (last
2 debt), the footer target-size fix, and the QB-remainder.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · ROUND 21 GATE TIGHTENED — design-fidelity #12 is now a REAL
**PER-TIER** assertion (founder-ordered). Was a flat "≥1 rich component anywhere"
check; now each tier layout emits `data-tier` on `<main>` (`pageTier` front-matter on
t-hub/location/mofu/guide/bofu → base.njk), and check #12 hard-fails any content page
that carries NONE of the rich components ITS OWN tier permits per the handoff
PLACEMENT-MAP (✓/opt allowed; "—" components do NOT satisfy a tier). `TIER_ALLOWED` map
transcribed directly from PLACEMENT-MAP.md. **The teeth bit immediately:** it caught **9
t-bofu service pages** (fractional-cfo · catch-up/cleanup/monthly bookkeeping · sales-tax ·
qb cleanup/migration/payroll/setup) elevated round-16→18 with hub/mofu components
(buyer-card/vs-table/pull-quote — all "—" for BOFU) but carrying NONE of BOFU's signatures
(proof-strip/full intake-form/flow). Same finding-class the design audit named: GREEN ≠
implements-the-tier. Recorded as **mis-tiered debt** in design-fidelity-exceptions.json
(fix = the payroll-management pattern: proof-strip under hero + full intake-form; or
reconcile whether they're really t-mofu). **Gate now: 21 pass per-tier on merit · 11 DEBT**
(2 generic-primitive-only [/about/methodology/, /trust/] + the 9 mis-tiered bofu). Battery
GREEN. css-drift/manifest unaffected (data-tier/pageTier add no classes). **A page isn't
"done" until it passes design-fidelity PER-TIER.**
**NEXT:** founder reviewing the 6 error patterns (faq + hub) on preview; then re-pattern the
11 debt pages (9 bofu = proof-strip + intake-form; 2 = add any rich component) + resume the
QB-remainder on the approved fidelity patterns.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · ROUND 21 REPLICATION **COMPLETE** — problem-pattern replicated
to the 6 error children + the error-codes hub (founder-approved off the h202 proving
page). Each page: `error-badge` in the hero eyebrow · `byline-block` (E-E-A-T, renders
"Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor team" — never a personal name) · the self-fix
`process-diagram` → compact `fix-steps` · misused `review-card` grids (causes/signals/
variants/progression/why-worse/engagement/families) → `stack-8` · `call-breakout` box
before the operator section · `meta-reviewed` at the FAQ foot. The HUB (an index, not a
single-error page) takes byline-block + call-breakout + meta-reviewed + families/signals
→ stack-8; its genuine engagement-process `process-diagram` (Diagnostic→scope→fix→verify)
stays. **Structural re-pattern ONLY — zero data-file edits; every baseline heading + FAQ +
schema preserved** (content-equity GREEN on all 7; only the standing "The monthly brief."
removal + the c-series whitespace artifact, both pre-justified). **DESIGN-FIDELITY GATE: all
7 now pass on merit — debt 9→2** (only /about/methodology/ + /trust/ remain). Re-verify:
battery GREEN · overflow 7/7 clean 360/390/768 · axe 7/7 zero violations (25 passes) · LH
hub+c-series **CLS 0.0**, a11y/BP/SEO 100 (perf = host-throttle noise, benchmarkIndex
180–195). New probe scripts: `overflow_errpages.ps1` · `axe_errpages.ps1`.
**NEXT:** re-pattern /trust/ + /about/methodology/ (add a rich component → clear the last
debt); resume the QB-remainder (desktop/enterprise/consulting/proadvisor-team/which-plan)
on the approved fidelity patterns; research-log still N=0 pending founder seed.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · ROUND 21 FOUNDATION-CORRECTION **COMPLETE** — 5 proving pages
+ rulings + design-fidelity GATE. Pushed for final review before any replication.
**5 PROVING PAGES rebuilt to true handoff fidelity (founder-approved h202 + 4 more):**
h202 error-silo problem-pattern (`7ee1315`) · /online/ t-mofu vs-table+buyer-card
(`9927de5`) · /quickbooks/ t-hub buyer-card+flow+pull-quote (`690426b`) · payroll
t-bofu proof-strip+full intake-form (`75b242d`) · /quickbooks/faq/ t-guide ARTICLE
guide-grid+toc+byline+pull-quote (`<faq commit>`). Each: battery GREEN · axe 0 ·
overflow 360/375/753 · LH a11y/BP/SEO 100 · **CLS ~0**.
- **RULING 1 (`abb31bc`):** shared `_includes/partials/intake-form.njk` — the locked
  24-key contract in ONE place; contact/file-review/payroll `{% include %}` it with
  per-page params; contract verified preserved; payroll upgraded to the FULL form.
- **RULING 2 (`abb31bc`):** /online/ → file-review-primary (Sheet 9; applies to all
  future t-mofu products).
- **RULING 3:** research-log stays N=0 honest until the founder seeds (no fabrication).
- **LOGO CLS FIX v2 (`47205e5`):** the checkpoint-2 fix pinned only height; `width:auto`
  didn't reserve the box pre-decode, so the heaviest page (payroll full form) shifted
  AFTER first paint (CLS 0.155, real — NOT throttle, confirmed at benchmarkIndex 231).
  `.site-header__logo img{width:116px;height:30px}` fully reserves it → 0.0. Hardens
  every page. (Corrects an earlier throttle misattribution.)
- **PART 3 — DESIGN-FIDELITY GATE (`<part3 commit>`, STANDING):** run_battery.py #12.
  Every content page must use ≥1 handoff RICH component (buyer-card/vs-table/flow/
  pull-quote/toc/byline-block/meta-reviewed/intake-form/proof-strip/error-badge/
  fix-steps/call-breakout/stat__delta/diagram-figure/hero__motif) — generic-primitive-
  only pages hard-fail. GREEN ≠ matches-design; this is the gate the battery was missing.
  Result: **23 pages pass on merit · 9 known re-pattern DEBT** (the 6 error children +
  hub → replicate the h202 problem-pattern after sign-off; /trust/ + /about/methodology/
  → add a rich component). Debt tracked in `_build/battery/design-fidelity-exceptions.json`;
  remove each page from the list when re-patterned. **A page isn't "done" until it
  passes design-fidelity.** CSS gate 55,933B / 58KB. Bylines all render "Certified
  QuickBooks ProAdvisor team" (founder-name-zero holds). New: `extract_faq.py` +
  `_build/data/faq-content.json` (the 35 Q/A source). Bench: 8090 axe server killed
  during CLS diagnosis — restart before next axe run.
**NEXT (after founder + strategy-Claude sign-off):** replicate the problem-pattern to the
6 error children + hub; re-pattern /trust/ + /about/methodology/; resume the QB-remainder
(desktop/enterprise/consulting/proadvisor-team/which-plan) on the approved fidelity patterns.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · ROUND 21 CHECKPOINT 3 — FOUNDATION-CORRECTION (design fidelity).
**DESIGN-FIDELITY AUDIT (founder-ordered at the /online/ stop) → systemic gap CONFIRMED.**
Report: `_build/reports/round-21-design-audit.md`. Home implements the handoff; the
round-16→21 elevation pages PASS the battery but carry old-HTML sequencing on ~5
primitives (review-card/stack-8/grid/process-diagram/trust-row), UNDER-USING the
handoff's tier components. **GREEN ≠ matches-the-design.** Founder DECISION: pause
mass-production, re-pattern from the handoff, prove ONE true-fidelity page per tier,
sign off, THEN replicate. Build nothing beyond the 5 proving pages this round.
- **PART 1 DONE (`79f97b9`):** inventory found nearly ALL handoff components already
  in the bundle (buyer-card+vs-table in 03-conversion · flow+pull-quote in 05-tiers ·
  error-badge+fix-steps+call-breakout+proof-strip+stat__delta in 08-additions ·
  intake-form). The gap was under-USE, not absence. Only the t-guide ARTICLE furniture
  was missing (dropped round-10) → ported verbatim to 09-extensions: **toc · guide-grid
  + .article · byline-block · meta-reviewed.** Bytes minified **53,819→55,703 / 58KB**
  (+1,884, headroom 3,689 — no breach). css-drift/manifest GREEN.
- **PROBLEM-PATTERN MARKUP (no handoff render exists; built from 08-additions CSS):**
  `error-badge` = inline mono pill (the code) · `fix-steps` = `<ol class="fix-steps">`
  `<li><span class="n">1</span><div>…</div></li>` (mono number circles, compact —
  distinct from process-diagram) · `call-breakout` = `<div class="call-breakout">`
  `<div><p class="call-breakout__title">…</p><p class="call-breakout__sub">…</p></div>`
  `<a class="btn…">…</a></div>` (the "stuck? book a diagnostic" box before the CTA).
- **PART 2 — 5 PROVING PAGES (founder-confirmed), full handoff fidelity + full re-verify:**
  1. t-hub `/quickbooks/` — buyer-card routing · real vs-table · flow diagram · pull-quote · stat__delta.
  2. t-mofu product `/quickbooks/online/` — vs-table (QBO vs alts + plan compare) · buyer-card · byline-block+meta-reviewed · stop generic review-card.
  3. t-bofu `/accounting/payroll-management/` — **ADD the 24-key intake-form (founder ruling)** · proof-strip · one verified review-card · buyer-card.
  4. error-silo PROBLEM pattern `/quickbooks/help/error-codes/h202/` — error-badge · fix-steps · call-breakout · byline-block (gates the ~40-page error silo).
  5. t-guide ARTICLE `/quickbooks/help/error-codes/` hub — toc/guide-grid · article.prose · byline-block · pull-quote · meta-reviewed.
  EQUITY MUST STAY GREEN on every rebuild (all baseline headings/FAQ preserved). review-card → verified quotes only.
- **PART 3 — add a design-fidelity battery check** (per-tier handoff-component assertion
  per PLACEMENT-MAP) as a STANDING gate alongside equity/axe/overflow. A page isn't
  "done" until design-fidelity passes.
- STOP after the 5 + the check → push → founder/strategy-Claude review each vs the
  handoff → replicate to QB-remainder + re-pattern prior pages ONLY after sign-off.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · ROUND 21 CHECKPOINT 2 — ERROR-CODES CLUSTER COMPLETE.
**ERROR-CODES HUB + 6 CHILDREN DONE+VERIFIED** (t-guide, approved h202 pattern).
Pages **29 → 36** (+7). All battery GREEN · axe 0 · overflow 360/375/753 ·
LH a11y/BP/SEO 100 · CLS ≤0.002. Per-page commits: hub `862c9b3` · 15240 `3c30f39`

unrecoverable `dc96eb4`.
- **Hub** `/quickbooks/help/error-codes/` (63 headings, 7 FAQ, CollectionPage+

  6190/6000-77/6000-301/PS036/PS077/80070057/15215) render as heading text only

  page. **Resolves h202's hub link.**
- **6 children** each: TechArticle+HowTo+HowToStep+HowToTool+Service+FAQPage+WebPage+
  BreadcrumbList · honest-triage (disclosure above fold, first FAQ "official?"→No
  ADDITIVE, provider #organization) · SHORT stat-row values (768 lesson) · conversion
  seam · the per-code intents (qb-error-{15240,3371,ps038,c-series,6000,unrecoverable}).
  15240 41h · 3371 35h · ps038 33h/8faq · c-series 39h · 6000 41h/8faq · unrecoverable 40h/8faq.
- **⚠ EQUITY ARTIFACT (c-series):** baseline captured one H3 with a tag-strip
  whitespace artifact ("operation , not"); heading present VERBATIM, logged
  type:"artifact" (NOT a removal) in equity-exceptions.json. No founder sign-off
  needed — content is fully there.
**ROOT-CAUSE CSS FIX (global, helps every page):** the hub's first real probe found
**CLS 0.107** (h202 control = 0.001 same host → real, not host-noise). Cause: the
global `img,svg{height:auto}` reset in 02-base let the **header logo SVG** recompute
its height on decode (intrinsic aspect ≠ 116:30); on a heavy page the decode lands
AFTER first paint → header/hero shift. Fix: `.site-header__logo img{height:30px;
width:auto}` in 04-chrome (pins the box; **computed-style-neutral** — logo already
rendered 30px, so zero element drift; +46B bundle). Re-probe **CLS 0.107→0.0**.
CSS gate **53,819B / 58KB**. NEW script `refresh_prod.ps1` (stop :8125 → npm run
build:prod → restart). PROBE NOTE: under extreme host throttle (benchmarkIndex
~90–120, e.g. 3 back-to-back LH runs) font-swap CLS inflates on long pages; re-run
on a settled host (benchmarkIndex ≥170) confirms ~0 — verified on hub + unrecoverable.
**NEXT:** `/quickbooks/online/` (t-mofu product PROVING PAGE) → **STOP** for founder
approval of the product pattern before desktop/enterprise replicate. Then report + push.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · ROUND 20 — QB-silo completion batch (CHECKPOINT 1).
Design reconcile CONFIRMED: handoff = the SAME cobalt #2B4FD6 system the 27 pages
run (no migration). **PART A DONE+VERIFIED:** `/resources/research/` t-hub —
**US QuickBooks Cleanup Benchmarks** (DefinedTerm + Dataset schema); honest **N=0
collecting**, locked 8-field schema at `_build/data/cleanup-benchmarks.json`, NO
fabricated numbers; battery GREEN · axe 0 · overflow 345/375/753. **PART B
proving page DONE+VERIFIED:** `/quickbooks/help/error-codes/h202/` (t-guide, clean
elevation, equity GREEN 36h) — establishes the error-child TechArticle+HowTo
pattern (Sheet-7 honest-triage). **PART C fix 1 DONE:** QB hub body now links
cleanup/help/payroll in-content → payroll orphan RESOLVED (inbound 1→2); zero
in-content orphans. CSS gate 53,773B. Commits `23aebf8` (A) · `485d966` (h202) ·
checkpoint (C+docs). **Pages: 27→29.** Full report: **round-20.md**.
NEXT (gated on founder approval of the 2 proving patterns — research scaffold +
h202 error-page): build error-codes hub + 6 remaining children as a cluster; one
t-mofu product proving page (online) then desktop/enterprise; then consulting
(t-bofu) · proadvisor-team · which-plan · faq; finish PART C (advisory/network +1
inbound) + batch-end overflow/LH/interlink sweep. QB-remainder is ~70k words / 21
substantial pages (3,000–5,350w each) — genuinely multi-session.
**⚠ FOUNDER OWNERS NEEDED:** (1) who logs one anonymized row per cleanup close
(research dataset cannot self-populate — calendar-bound); (2) research-hub CTA
nuance ("Read the methodology" used where Sheet-9 names "Explore Services").
**⚠ PROBE INFRA:** chrome-headless stalled mid-session (documented leak) — axe ran
clean before the stall; overflow/LH calibrated sweep deferred to batch end.

## STANDING RULE — PROBE CHROME ISOLATION (founder, round 21 — HARD RULE)
The founder's personal Chrome is OFF-LIMITS, always. NEVER kill Chrome by image
name (`Get-Process chrome | Stop-Process`, `Stop-Process -Name chrome`, `taskkill
/IM chrome.exe`) — that closes the founder's browser/tabs. Every probe launches
headless Chrome with a dedicated isolated profile **`--user-data-dir=C:\tb-probe-
profile`** (the marker); all 28 chrome-launching scripts in `_build/scripts/`
carry it (patched round 21 via patch_probe_isolation.py). `kill_probe.ps1` now
matches ONLY processes whose command line contains `tb-probe-profile` and stops
just those PIDs — it reports `personal-chrome-untouched=N`. Run kill_probe BETWEEN
probe launches (each launch holds the isolated profile's singleton lock until it
exits; consecutive launches without a kill stall — that was the round-20
"chrome-leak", root-caused round 21: probes were sharing the founder's DEFAULT
profile, which both stalled dumps via the singleton lock AND let the old
image-name kill close the founder's tabs). Bug fixed; both symptoms gone.
INLINE chrome one-offs dump unreliably — use the *script* form (overflow_probe.ps1
etc.); they're reliable with kill_probe between.
DESIGN NOTE (round 21): `.stat-row` becomes `display:flex` with large gaps at
≥768px — `stat__value` is for SHORT numeric metrics only (e.g. "4", "L2", "48hr").
Long word-values ("Enterprise") overflow the container at 768. (Caught + fixed on
h202.)

## STANDING RULE — RESEARCH-LOG CAPTURE (founder, round 21 — owner SET)
**Owner: the FOUNDER logs one anonymized row at each cleanup-engagement close**
(moment of capture = engagement close). Rows go into `_build/data/cleanup-
benchmarks.json` under the LOCKED 8-field schema (engagement_id · state · industry
· months_behind_at_intake · primary_error_types · txn_volume_band · cleanup_hours ·
cost_band). The founder hands raw facts; Claude writes clean rows. **Anonymization/
integrity (HARD — this becomes publicly citable):** engagement_id is an opaque token
(ENG-0001…), NEVER a client name/initials/re-identifying detail; no city granularity
finer than state; bands (txn_volume_band, cost_band) use fixed ranges, never exact
figures; every value REAL from an actual closed engagement (no estimates, no
rounding-to-look-good, no fabricated fills — a blank field stays blank). The live
`/resources/research/` page reads N and publishes NO breakdown statistic until N≥20,
so seeding (<20) updates only the honest live count. **⚠ AWAITING:** the founder's
raw engagement facts to seed the first rows (requested in round-21 report — NOT
invented). Until provided, dataset stays N=0, honest. See [[research scaffold]] (PART A).

## STANDING RULE — HUB-REFRESH-ON-SPOKE-ADD (round 20)
When a spoke ships, update the parent hub BODY **and** ≥1 topical sibling BODY to
link it **in-content** (not just nav). Round-19 found later-built spokes (payroll,
cleanup, help) carried in-content back-link debt because earlier hub/sibling
bodies weren't updated when they shipped. Every new page this batch links into the
hub + siblings on ship; the batch-end interlink audit must show 0 in-content
orphans.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · ROUND 18 — CLOSE: **CF DEPLOY RESOLVED via project
separation.** New Pages project **`techbrot-preview`** (branch preview-11ty,
output `_site`, no ENVIRONMENT=production) is **live + rendering cobalt + noindex
at https://techbrot-preview.pages.dev** — verified: `/`→200, site.min.css→200
text/css, meta noindex + robots.txt Disallow:/. OLD project `techbrot`
(→techbrot.com, old Bootstrap) UNTOUCHED — do NOT modify. The CSS-404/output-dir
saga is CLOSED (7cc89e2 first-class CSS template stays correct). Review model now:
push = deploy = review on the CF URL (not localhost). **27 pages elevated** (R16
+ R17 batches done). Full handoff: **_build/reports/round-18-close.md**.
NEXT SESSION: start the research/original-data logging scaffold (calendar-bound,
NOT STARTED), then California state children off the NY master template.

Updated: 2026-06-14 · ROUND 17 — elevation campaign + Cloudflare CSS fix.
**CF CSS-404 FIXED** (commit 7cc89e2 — see _build/reports/cloudflare-fix.md):
site.min.css was written by a side-effect `eleventy.before` fs.writeFileSync
(outside Eleventy's pipeline → could drop from the CF deploy → unstyled). Moved
to a FIRST-CLASS Eleventy template (src/assets/css/site.min.css.11ty.js) so the
bundle is a tracked output, always in _site, always deployed. Verified via
fresh-clone `npm ci --omit=dev` + `npm run build` + `npx serve _site` →
/assets/css/site.min.css 200 text/css. **UNPUSHED: 7cc89e2 (CSS fix) + baaea7d
(payroll) — founder pushes.** (Problem-1 deps fix 6d30375 already pushed in
ced7855 — that's why pages load; the CSS issue was separate.)
ROUND 17 batch: **COMPLETE — all 7 clean elevations DONE + verified + committed**
(payroll `baaea7d`; sales-tax `0b765da`; advisory hub `026e065`; fractional-cfo
`10458cf`; qb-cleanup `32eff23`; qb-help hub `833bef5`; qb-payroll `0bb09a0`).
**1099-preparation DEFERRED** (build-new — founder ruling). Full battery GREEN
across 33 URLs (2369 hrefs resolve, css gate 53,773B). Every page: equity GREEN ·
axe 0 · overflow PASS · LH 100/100/100 · CLS 0 (qb-payroll 0.006 ≈ 0). CF CSS fix
(7cc89e2) + all round-17 commits UNPUSHED — founder pushes preview-11ty. Dev
server RUNNING http://192.168.1.8:8080/. Report: **round-17.md**.
Elevated total: 25 of 139 + home + file-review. (Counts OLD-baseline pages
elevated to the cobalt standard; the Sheet-5 200-page gate also counts the
already-DONE industry/location/VS/legal sets — see Sheet 5.)

## DEFERRED + RESTORE FLAGS
- **/accounting/1099-preparation/ — DEFERRED (build-new).** No baseline, no root
  HTML; founder ruling round 17 → future dedicated build-new round (with
  /about/team/ + the switch silo).
- **RESTORE when 1099 is built:** the payroll-management cross-sell card "1099
  preparation" (baseline H3) was retargeted to "QuickBooks cleanup" to avoid a
  dead link; logged in equity-exceptions.json (`/accounting/payroll-management/`).
  Repoint it back to /accounting/1099-preparation/ once that page exists.

## SIGN-OFF QUEUE (equity-exceptions.json — 25 flagged removals, all reported)
Standing/founder-ruled (no per-page sign-off): "The monthly brief." newsletter
removals + footer-chrome relocations (Accounting/QuickBooks/Company/Network under
chrome:minimal). **Awaiting explicit founder sign-off:**
- **QAPage → FAQPage** (FAQPage is the correct multi-Q type): monthly-bookkeeping,
  cleanup-bookkeeping, catch-up-bookkeeping (R16) · payroll-management, sales-tax-
  compliance, advisory, fractional-cfo (R17). 7 pages.
- **Schema-only condensed FAQ variants retired** (substance carried verbatim by
  the rendered Q): monthly-bookkeeping ×2 · payroll ×1 · sales-tax ×2 · advisory
  ×2 · fractional-cfo ×4.
- **R16 setup 4-vs-5 phase ruling** — baseline documents 4 setup phases; founder
  asked for 5. Preserved 4 as the TechBrot Setup Protocol; awaiting ruling on
  adding a 5th.
- **R16 carryover:** /about/methodology/ "The Team" card retarget; /partners/ FAQ
  schema-defect fixes (round 8). Still awaiting sign-off.
- **R17:** the 1099 cross-sell removal (restore flag above).

- **Build note:** eleventy --serve does NOT auto-rebuild NEW templates added
  after start — `npm run build` (→_site) for each new page. Lighthouse/overflow
  probe the PROD artifact on 8125 (`_site-prod`); a new page must be in
  `_site-prod` or they hit a 404 (false pass). **⚠ Refresh `_site-prod` with
  `npm run build:prod` ONLY — do NOT run `build-prod.ps1`: its first step
  `extract_css.py` RE-EXTRACTS CSS from the design handoff and REVERTS every
  hand-edited fix in src/assets/css/*.css (round 12–15 gapped-mark content-box,
  ≤480 phone rules, etc.). It clobbered them once this round (caught + restored
  from f725474; the manual CSS fixes live only in the extracted files, not the
  design source).** To rebuild _site-prod: stop the 8125 server (it locks the
  dir → EBUSY on clean), `npm run build:prod`, restart `npx serve -l 8125
  _site-prod`. Dev server (8080) NOT killed.

## CLOUDFLARE DEPLOY CONTRACT (round 16 — fixed the unstyled/no-home preview)
Two preview failures diagnosed: (1) pages rendered unstyled — `site.min.css`
missing; (2) home `/` didn't load. **Root cause:** all build tools
(`@11ty/eleventy`, `@11ty/eleventy-img`, `esbuild`, `cross-env`) were in
`devDependencies`. `site.min.css` is generated at build time by the eleventy
esbuild hook and `index.html` (home) by `src/index.njk` — neither is committed
(`_site/` is gitignored). When Cloudflare's prod environment omits devDependencies
(standard when `NODE_ENV=production`), `eleventy` isn't installed, `npm run build`
fails, no `_site` is produced, and Cloudflare falls back to serving the **repo
root** — which has no home (founder deleted it) and no `site.min.css` (the old
`assets/` only has the legacy Bootstrap CSS). Exactly the two symptoms.
**Fix (commit pending):** moved the four build tools to `dependencies`
(`axe-core` stays devDependency — test-only); regenerated `package-lock.json`
(build tools now `dev=false`). Proven: `npm ls --omit=dev` lists all four; a clean
`npm run build` produces a complete self-contained `_site` (home 72KB +
`site.min.css` 53,773B + all 26 pages + js/fonts); plain `npx serve _site`
(true CF proxy, NOT the dev server) serves `/`→200, `/assets/css/site.min.css`
→200 text/css, every page →200, styled.
**Cloudflare Pages settings (confirm in dashboard):**
- Build command: `npm run build`  ·  Build output directory: `_site`  ·  Root: `/`
- Production env var: `ENVIRONMENT=production` (Production deployment ONLY — flips
  noindex→index + GA4 on). Preview leaves it unset (noindex, fail-closed).
- Do NOT use `build-prod.ps1` anywhere (its `extract_css.py` step clobbers CSS —
  see build-prod note). `npm run build` alone produces the complete site.
- Nothing depends on the eleventy dev server or any separate manual step.

## STANDING RULE — CTA STRATEGY (founder, 2026-06-14, round 16; governs every page)
Per-tier hero/band CTA mapping. Applies to all round-16 pages + every future
page. **Never a phone CTA as a hero CTA on a hub. Never "Speak to a ProAdvisor"
as primary on any page. Never "Explore Services" as primary except a hub hero.**
- **HUB (t-hub):** hero PRIMARY "Explore Services" (deeper into silo) · hero
  SECONDARY "Book the discovery call" (→/contact/?intent=…) · NO phone in hero.
- **BOFU service:** hero PRIMARY "Book the discovery call" · SECONDARY "Get the
  free file review" · TERTIARY (QuickBooks-specific BOFU ONLY — setup, migration,
  help, error-code) "Speak to a ProAdvisor" (tel). NOT on bookkeeping BOFU
  (monthly/cleanup/catch-up).
- **MOFU/GUIDE:** hero PRIMARY "Get the free file review" · SECONDARY "Book the
  discovery call".
- **FINAL CTA BAND (every page incl. hubs):** PRIMARY always "Book the discovery
  call" (visitor is warm). A phone secondary in the band is permitted.
- **Phone-link mechanism:** hero/band actions render phone via `action.tel:true`
  (layouts substitute `tel:{{ site.phone.e164 }}` — single source). NEVER put a
  `{{ }}` var in front-matter JSON href (front matter is NOT Nunjucks-rendered —
  it ships the literal string = broken link). Fixed sitewide round 16.

## CONTACT-PAGE REBUILD RULES — LOGGED (do when /contact/ is rebuilt; NOT yet built)
1. **Intent system:** /contact/ heading, subheading, and form fields respond to
   the `?intent=` URL param — each intent maps to a specific heading, paragraph,
   and pre-selected form options (personalized landing matching the origin page).
   Intent registry lives in `src/_data/intents.json` (battery enforces every CTA
   intent key exists there). `accounting` key added round 16.
2. **CTA pattern above form:** contact hero = primary button ("Book the discovery
   call" scrolls to form anchor) + the 404-style phone block (circular cobalt
   icon + large number + "a ProAdvisor answers"). Form below. Match 404 exactly.
3. **NO sticky elements on /contact/:** suppress all sticky bars / sticky phone /
   sticky nav CTAs — visitor is converting, sticky = friction.

## ROUND 15 — nav fixes + full responsiveness audit DONE + VERIFIED
(phone full-number all widths · flush-right · drawer align · nav/drawer mutual
exclusion · quick-5 +5px · overflow ALL 14 PAGES PASS). Report: round-15.md.

## ROUND 15 — nav/chrome fixes + responsiveness audit (done + verified)
Full report: round-15.md. Scope: nav/chrome only; design tokens + 1 JS fix.
- **FIX1 phone:** R13 number-hide REVERTED — icon + FULL number at all widths;
  at ≤480 tightens (`fs-13` + `ls-tight`) + header gaps compress (space-3/2).
  Orphan `site-header__phone-num` class removed. Verified true 360.
- **FIX2 flush-right:** `.site-header .container` `justify-content:space-between`
  → logo left / actions right (desktop nav margin-right:auto intact). 360+1280.
- **FIX3 drawer head:** `width:100%` added → logo left / X right. Captured 360.
- **FIX4 mutual exclusion (tb-nav.js):** desktop `closeAllMenus` already; ADDED
  drawer `closeOtherPanels`. Functional test: 2 clicks → 1 open (both desktop
  dropdowns + drawer panels). axe ZERO.
- **FIX5 quick-5:** `.ai-summary__question` fs-15→fs-20 (+5px). Captured 360+1280,
  no overflow in narrow column.
- **FIX6 overflow audit:** ALL 14 pages PASS at 360/390/768 (sw ≤360/375/753);
  the prior 4px drawer phantom is GONE (resolved by FIX1/3).
- **Verify:** battery GREEN · axe ZERO (home/about/pricing) · gate 53,773 B ·
  zero-drift element counts STABLE (home 782/terms 378/partners 676), hashes
  shift only from the intended global header + quick-5 changes.
- New scripts: shot_drawer.ps1, nav_test.ps1.

## ROUND 14 — footer brand fix + credential display + nav-CTA verify (PASS);
local git repo on branch `preview-11ty` (commit 1981ef5), FAIL-CLOSED; PUSH
BLOCKED on founder GitHub access. Report: **round-14.md**.

## ROUND 14 — footer · credentials · nav-CTA · preview branch (awaiting push)
Full report: round-14.md. Parts A/B/C done+verified; D = local branch ready,
push is founder's.
- **(A) FOOTER brand language:** site.json `tagline` → "An independent firm of
  Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisors." (only consumer = footer note). Zero-drift:
  home/trust fingerprints IDENTICAL (text-only); bundle byte-identical
  (53,611 B). Battery + axe GREEN.
- **(B) CREDENTIAL display:** "Bookkeeping" added to visible cert lists on
  /about/ + /pricing/ (team aggregate: QBO L2 + Desktop + Payroll + Bookkeeping
  [founder] + Enterprise [David]). No individual named; "Certified QuickBooks
  ProAdvisor team" attribution stays. content-equity GREEN both; axe ZERO.
- **(C) NAV CTA at narrow widths:** PASS — header `.site-header__cta` is hidden
  ≤920px (covers ≤480). Verified true-360 iframe capture (header = logo +
  phone-icon + hamburger only). No change.
- **(D) PREVIEW BRANCH:** repo was NOT git-initialized → did local `git init`,
  branch **`preview-11ty`**, commit **1981ef5** (717 files; .gitignore excludes
  node_modules/_site/_site-prod/_build-verify/.claude). **Fail-closed VERIFIED**
  (preview build = noindex + robots Disallow + no GA4). **PUSH BLOCKED** — no
  remote/creds; founder runs `git remote add origin
  https://github.com/techbrot5/techbrot.git` + `git push -u origin
  preview-11ty`. Expected preview URL: `preview-11ty.techbrot.pages.dev`
  (post-push). **main/techbrot.com UNTOUCHED** (no remote configured).
  🛑 CRITICAL: Cloudflare `ENVIRONMENT=production` must be Production-only,
  NOT Preview, or the preview indexes (harming the old site). Build settings
  (CORRECTED): ONE command `npm run build` (NOT `build:prod` — that hardcodes
  ENVIRONMENT=production via cross-env and would index the preview), output
  `_site`, env var `ENVIRONMENT=production` on the Production env only →
  prod indexes + dev excluded, preview fail-closed automatically.

## ROUND 13 — mobile-nav fix + head migration DONE + VERIFIED; Cloudflare
deploy local-prep done, BLOCKED on founder access. Report: **round-13.md**.

## ROUND 13 — mobile-nav · head migration · deploy-prep (awaiting founder for C)
Round-12 rulings applied (lexicon "Become a Partner", "The Team" retarget,
team excluded, timeline flagged, soft-cap noted). Full report: round-13.md.
- **(A) MOBILE NAV — fixed + verified.** Root cause: header flex row (logo +
  full phone + hamburger) overran true phone widths, clipping the hamburger
  (masked by Chrome `--window-size` clamping — true-360 iframe reproduced it).
  Fix (global, tokens): phone → tappable icon ≤480px (number hidden, link
  keeps aria-label), `.site-header__actions{min-width:0}`,
  `body{scrollbar-gutter:stable}`. Verified true 360/390 (iframe), battery +
  axe green, element counts unchanged.
- **(B) HEAD MIGRATION — done.** Entity graph (schemaGlobal) expertise-first:
  all platform/network language removed from Org/Brand/WebSite/service
  descriptions; **David Westgate removed from `employee`** → Texas operating
  partner (not staff); **founder Person = E-E-A-T anchor only**, creds
  QBO L2/Desktop/Payroll/Bookkeeping (Enterprise dropped from founder, kept
  via David; Advisory NOT claimed), url→/about/. Fonts/preloads verified,
  theme-color #FBFAF7. **Per-page heads: all 13 pages + 404 pass** ≤60 title
  (·TechBrot suffix) / ≤155 desc / phone on high-intent only. Schema + FAQ +
  equity all GREEN post-migration. Tool: head_audit.py.
- **(C) CLOUDFLARE DEPLOY — local prep done, BLOCKED.** NEW /sitemap.xml (13
  URLs) + /robots.txt (FAIL-CLOSED: prod Allow+Sitemap, preview Disallow) +
  .gitignore. Prod env verified (index,follow + GA4 on; fail-closed both
  ways). **Repo is NOT git-initialized + no Cloudflare/GitHub/DNS/GSC access**
  → 8 founder-action blockers listed in round-13.md (git+GitHub, Cloudflare
  Pages project + ENVIRONMENT=production env var, DNS, preview X-Robots-Tag
  header, GA4 live check, PageSpeed, live form TEST-MIGRATION-2026, GSC
  sitemap submit). Build settings: cmd `npm run build:prod`, out `_site-prod`,
  env `ENVIRONMENT=production`.
- **OPEN (sign-off):** credential reconciliation (founder = QBO L2/Desktop/
  Payroll/Bookkeeping; David holds Enterprise) — confirm the Bookkeeping
  program name + David's Enterprise + whether to add "Bookkeeping" to the
  visible /about/ + /pricing/ cert lists. Phone-in-meta on home (kept).

## ROUND 12 **COMPLETE** — STEP 0 mark fixes + extension (all motif marks
gapped) + homepage diagram + the **about-silo + /pricing/ elevation batch
(4 pages) ALL BUILT + VERIFIED**. Reports: round-11.md · **round-12.md**.

## ROUND 12 · STEP 0 — quick-5 underscore + double-border fixes (awaiting check)
Two sitewide CSS mark fixes, design-system tokens only. STOPPED for founder
check BEFORE the page batch. Full report: _build/reports/round-12.md.
- **(A) QUICK-5 UNDERSCORE — fixed + uniform.** Root cause: the mark was
  border-built (`width:3px`+16/7 borders) under the global
  `box-sizing:border-box` reset → the 3px gap COLLAPSED to a solid bar (not
  the Design's 16/3/7 gapped underscore); also gated by `--ruled` and
  duplicated in 03-conversion + 06-motif-rules. Fix (06-motif-rules, single
  source): `box-sizing:content-box` (gap survives) + UNCONDITIONAL
  `.ai-summary__question::after` (every question, every page) + de-duped.
  Border technique kept per the file's documented capture-robustness note;
  renders the Design's gapped underscore exactly. Verified visually
  (shots/r12/fr-quick5.png — all 5 gapped).
- **(B) DOUBLE-BORDER on numbered components — one accent mark.**
  `.process-diagram .process-step::before` was a cobalt accent top-rule +
  grey box-shadow sub-rule + cobalt number (two accent marks). Now a single
  light-GREY hairline (`height:1px; var(--border-hairline)`, box-shadow
  removed); the cobalt number is the lone accent. process-diagram is the
  ONLY numbered component with an accent top-rule (complete application).
  Verified (shots/r12/fr-process.png).
- **Verification:** battery ALL GREEN (css-drift token-only · 52,612 B) ·
  axe home+partners ZERO violations · zero-drift probe — legal ×4 CONTROL
  byte-identical to the r10 baseline (no global regression), home/trust
  CHANGED (intended; element counts unchanged = pure restyle).
- **OPEN (founder ruling):** the SAME box-sizing gap-collapse hits the other
  border-built motif marks (hero--rule, pull-quote, disclosure,
  site-footer__disclosure) — they render as solid bars, not the Design's
  gapped marks. Recommend the same one-line content-box fix; held, out of
  STEP 0 scope. New script: probe_check.ps1.

## ROUND 12 BATCH — PREP LOCKED (founder rulings 2026-06-13, before build)
### Tier ruling (founder, overrides blueprint Sheet 1 MOFU for the parent)
- **/about/ = t-hub** (dark hero + alignment-field motif) — the silo entry /
  trust hub. **/about/methodology/ = t-mofu · /about/network/ = t-mofu**
  (compact hero). /pricing/ = t-bofu (blueprint + founder agree).
- **/about/team/ EXCLUDED from this batch** — no baseline record (build-new
  queue, no repo folder); not an elevation, and the authorship model below
  means no visible team byline/photo. Build fresh in a later round.
### AUTHORSHIP MODEL (founder, 2026-06-13 — STANDING; refines CLAUDE.md rule 9)
- Firm-level credentialed team, **NOT named individuals**. Visible
  reviewer/author on every page = **"Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor team"**
  — never a personal name (founder-name-zero stands).
- The founder **Person node lives in SCHEMA ONLY** as the off-page E-E-A-T
  credential anchor, referenced by @id — real ProAdvisor credentials: **QBO
  Level 2, Desktop, Enterprise, Payroll, + Advisory when complete**. No
  visible /about/team/ byline, no photo, no visible name.
- **David Westgate** is the named **Texas operating partner ONLY** where that
  relationship is real and already approved — never asserted as a TechBrot
  employee. Build /about/ to this model.
### Batch blueprint contracts (from blueprint v3 Sheet 1/0 — recorded here so
the tracker carries the assignments; the blueprint xlsx remains the master
architecture doc per CLAUDE.md)
| URL | Tier | Silo | Parent | Schema (carry baseline + these) | AI angle |

  · Lighthouse desktop a11y 100 / BP 100 / SEO 100 / CLS 0 (pricing, about,
  methodology spot-checked; network = same t-mofu template) · CSS gate
  53,491 B / 59,392 B · screenshots in _build/verify/shots/r12/.
- Canonical pricing (Sheet 0, identical everywhere): **Monthly $400–$2,500+/mo
  · Cleanup $1,500–$15,000+ · Catch-up $2,000–$20,000+ · QB setup $750–$5,000+**
  (+ migration/payroll/CFO — full line in Sheet 0) · intent-registry ledges
  carry per-tier ranges. NO invented figures.
- /about/network/ missing-canonical (TODO 3) — fix at elevation.
### SOURCE-OF-TRUTH — STANDING RULE (founder 2026-06-13, Option A)
- **blueprint.xlsx remains the MASTER URL/architecture doc** (the full
  139-page map). BUILD-TRACKER carries live build state + each batch's full
  contracts as built. Do NOT port all 139 rows into the tracker.
- **At the START of every batch:** read the target pages' architecture (URL,
  tier, intents, schema, silo parent/children, AI-angle) from blueprint.xlsx,
  confirm against the tracker, FLAG any conflict for a ruling BEFORE building,
  then build and record the contracts in the tracker. Keeps the blueprint
  authoritative and the tracker current without duplicating the whole map.

## ROUND 11 — POLISH PASS **APPROVED** (header-align no-op · FAQ flatten +
faq-flat standing check · within-page variety incl. the #partners-principles
follow-up). New session/model (Opus 4.8 1M) VALIDATED by founder.
Reports: round-10.md (debut) · **round-11.md**

## ROUND 11 — POLISH PASS (APPROVED by founder 2026-06-13)
**Audit ruling:** clean pass, new session/model validated. (c) extended:
#partners-principles (parallel list of 6) → `grid-3` review-cards — removes
the LAST numbered-grid repeat; /partners/ now reads benefits=numbered
`.process-diagram` · process=`.flow`+cards · principles=`grid-3` cards (one
process-diagram total). Re-verified GREEN: battery (process-diagram count
=1) · axe ZERO violations · overflow 364/375/753 · zero-drift probe
/partners/ `1e73d530`@1280 / `a042b7ed`@360 (676 elems; home re-confirmed
`e20c9459` identical) · gate 52,660 B unchanged. Original round-11 record:
Three queued polish items only; NO new pages. Proved the new session drives
the factory cleanly before the elevation grind resumes. Full report:
_build/reports/round-11.md (ends with OPEN ITEMS / STOPPED AT).
- **(a) HEADER ALIGN — VERIFIED ALREADY ALIGNED, NO CHANGE.** New
  diagnostic edge_probe.ps1 measured header.container == hero heading ==
  every full-width body container to the pixel at 360/480/768/900/1280.
  The 04-chrome L11 `.container` override is DEAD (canonical 05-tiers
  `.container` wins). The only inset-differently element is the centered
  narrow reading-column (>900px) — intentional. **FOUNDER CONFIRMED the
  round-10 visual impression was wrong; closed no-change.** Zero CSS
  touched → bundle byte-identical (52,660 B).
- **(b) FAQ FLATTEN + STANDING CHECK.** /partners/ nested accordion
  (6 parents + 13 children) FLATTENED to 19 flat Q/A (contact shape), each
  former parent followed by its former children, text verbatim. FAQPage
  schema now 19 Q/A verbatim (faq-schema-verbatim GREEN at 19);
  content-equity GREEN (no loss). **NEW standing battery check `faq-flat`**
  (run_battery.py #11): no nested-FAQ markup, no `<ul>/<ol>` in any
  faq__answer — enforced sitewide; all 4 FAQ pages flat. Nested FAQ is now
  forbidden sitewide.
- **(c) WITHIN-PAGE VARIETY.** #partners-process (the page's 2nd sequential
  component) converted from numbered `.process-diagram` to the
  design-system `.flow` strip (Apply→Fit Call→Verification→Onboarding +
  timings + arrow connectors, role=img) over a `grid-2` of review-cards
  (per-phase detail; baseline H3s preserved). Zero new CSS (flow/grid-2/
  review-card all in-bundle + manifest). Distinct from the numbered grid
  used by #partners-benefits.
- **Verification:** battery ALL GREEN (incl. faq-flat) · zero-drift probe —
  home/contact/trust BYTE-IDENTICAL to the round-10 baseline, /partners/
  the only change (644→682 elems, intended) · overflow 360/390/768 =
  364(benign drawer phantom)/375/753 · Lighthouse desktop /partners/ a11y
  100 / BP 100 / SEO 100 / CLS 0 (perf host-limited, gate item 4) ·
  **axe /partners/ ZERO violations** · gate 52,660 B (unchanged).
- **OPEN (founder ruling):** #partners-principles is a 3rd `.process-diagram`
  instance — round-11 scope named only benefits+process; NOT touched
  (no over-reach). Rule whether principles should also get a distinct
  treatment. Dead nested-FAQ CSS in 09-extensions left for the next
  source-trim. New tooling: edge_probe.ps1 · kill_probe.ps1 ·
  shot_anchor.ps1 gained -Port/-Root.

## ROUND 10 — DESIGN SYSTEM CHANGEOVER (complete & approved, debut accepted)
Reports: round-10-step3.md · round-10-step6.md · **round-10.md (debut)**

## ✅ ROUND 10 APPROVED — DEBUT ACCEPTED (founder, 2026-06-13)
- New brand LIVE · axe clean ×11 surfaces · Lighthouse 100/100/100
  CLS~0 · no-traces proven · gate held 52.7 KB.
- **The cobalt / warm-paper / Fraunces system is now the GO-FORWARD
  BASELINE.** The old oxblood system is fully retired.
- **The probe fingerprint captured this round
  (_build/verify/css-probe-newskin-baseline.txt) is the NEW REGRESSION
  ANCHOR** — future CSS-touching rounds diff against it.
- **OLD-SKIN ARCHIVE RETAINED at _build/archive/old-skin/ — DO NOT
  DELETE** (founder order stands).

## NEXT-SESSION POLISH QUEUE — ✅ DONE IN ROUND 11 (see round-11 section above)
(a) header-align = verified no-op · (b) FAQ flatten + faq-flat standing
check = done · (c) within-page variety applied to #partners-process (flow).
Residual: #partners-principles 3rd process-diagram instance flagged for
ruling. Original queue text retained below for the audit record.
- **(a) HEADER ALIGNMENT (global chrome, one place):** the chrome
  container (logo/nav/phone row) is inset differently from the page/body
  container at BOTH mobile and desktop. Align the header's inner
  container to the SAME `--container-padding` as the body so header and
  content share one left edge. Fix in the 04-chrome installer (the
  `.container` override / header rules), one place, re-verify at 360 +
  desktop.
- **(b) FAQ PATTERN — standardize to the /contact/ shape sitewide:**
  flat question → prose answer · NO bullet lists inside answers · NO
  nested child-Q/As. WHERE A PAGE'S BASELINE FAQ WAS NESTED (e.g.
  /partners/ — 6 parents + 13 children), FLATTEN WITHOUT LOSING EQUITY:
  every parent AND child question/answer survives as its own flat Q/A
  pair. The content-equity differ must still pass; FAQPage schema stays
  verbatim to the rendered text. **Make this a STANDING BATTERY CHECK**
  (e.g. `faq-flat`: no faq__children / faq__child / nested markup; no
  `<ul>/<ol>` inside faq__answer).
- **(c) WITHIN-PAGE SECTION VARIETY (per-page composition rule):** the
  same numbered-grid / process-diagram component must NOT repeat twice
  on one page. Applied at each page's elevation/review, page-by-page —
  NOT one blunt global swap. Where a page repeats it now (e.g.
  /partners/ benefits + process), give the second instance a different
  treatment (e.g. process → flow/timeline). Log per page as elevated.

## STANDING RULE — NEW SECTIONS (founder, 2026-06-13, governs the grind)
Every new section built from here: **premium, purposeful UI.** SVG
diagrams / flows / charts (ProcessFlow, ComparisonGrid, DecisionTree,
BarChart from the design system) used WHERE THEY AID understanding,
conversion, or AI-citation — NEVER decorative. Every section earns its
place. Intents wired and logical on every CTA. Within the design
system's motion + token language ONLY — no new ad-hoc styles. (Governs
elevation, not the changeover round.)

## ROUND 10 · BLOCK 3 — RE-BASELINE + FULL VERIFICATION + DEBUT (steps 7–9)
### Step-6 audit rulings applied
- Manifest grep formalized as standing battery check `manifest`.
- KEEP_ADDITIONS curation = documented re-entry point.
- "Get the file diagnosed" kept in the lexicon (awaits first problem page).
- Old-skin archive RETAINED through the audit (no deletion).
- TODO 8 (mono) CLOSED · TODO 2 (vector logo) SUPERSEDED by the brand chain.
### Step 7 — re-baseline
- **AA verified IN-BUILD** (verify_aa.py): every text token clears its
  floor on every tier tint; teal focus ring ≥3:1 all tints + dark
  (3.52–4.24); every button state pins fill AND label. Confirms
  AA-MATRIX.md (one doc note: brass-bright on dark computes 7.98 vs
  printed 7.6 — both pass; computed is safer — CANONICAL value).
- css-drift re-pointed at SKIN tokens (01-tokens.css is the only hex home;
  checker now comment-aware).
- Go-forward fingerprint baseline captured
  (css-probe-newskin-baseline.txt, 11 surfaces × 1280/360, 0 failures).
  Probe settle bumped 700→1100ms (homepage cold-start robustness).
- `manifest` standing battery check live.
- Gate headroom: minified 52,660 B / 59,392 B (6,732 B).
### Step 8 — full verification ×10 + 404
- **axe-core: ZERO violations on all 11 surfaces.**
- **Lighthouse desktop: a11y 100 / BP 100 / SEO 100 / CLS 0 on all 10
  content pages** (404: a11y/BP/CLS perfect, SEO 66 = intentional
  noindex `is-crawlable` only).
- Keyboard (interaction_test.ps1): nav dropdown + drawer Escape-close,
  FAQ one-at-a-time — all pass.
- Overflow 360/390/768 clean (full-chrome pages carry a benign 4px
  off-screen-drawer phantom at true 360; body overflow-x:hidden = no
  user scroll, nothing cut — documented rounds-4/5 precedent).
- call-bar zero-CLS (`.has-call-bar` reserve) + auto-hide verified;
  reduced-motion zeroing incl. scroll entrance; @view-transition stays
  commented.
- **Real fixes the suite found** (all in the installer / session layer,
  survive re-install): vs-table → `.vs-scroll` (real 518px@360 overflow)
  · util-bar hidden ≤920 · drawer `<aside>`→`<div role=dialog>` +
  visibility:hidden when closed · dark-footer strong/disclosure/slim
  links re-inked light (were 1.02:1 dark-on-dark) · scroll-entrance
  transform-only (was opacity:0.01, failing contrast) · partners FAQ
  `<dl>/<dt>/<dd>`→`<div>/<h3>/<div>` (axe definition-list; schema
  verbatim still GREEN).
### Step 9 — DEBUT AUDIT (round-10.md)
- Every page screenshotted desktop + 360 beside the Design renders
  (_build/verify/shots/debut/ + DESIGN-{contact,file-review,404} pairs).
  Visual language matches; OURS pages taller (elevated baseline content).
- No-traces PASSED · byte report · probe delta (100% changed = full
  re-skin, intentional) · AA in-build · all flags.
### Debut state
- Battery ALL GREEN (incl. content-equity ×7, cta-lexicon, manifest).
- CSS minified 52,660 B / 59,392 B (6,732 B headroom) · source 75,018 B.
- 10 built pages + 404 on the new cobalt/warm-paper/Fraunces skin.

## ROUND 10 · BLOCK 2 — PAGE RE-SKIN + NO-TRACES + CTA LEXICON
### Step-3 audit rulings applied
- section--cta-band--light WHITELISTED (known upstream manifest
  omission — the design's own renders use it).
- .section--alt mapped as a one-line tokenized definition in
  09-extensions (class name kept across pages per ruling).
- Metric corrections / icon replacements / cascade fix RATIFIED — the
  corrected metric values are CANONICAL (Fraunces 97.8/25.5 +
  size-adjust 106.8 · Public Sans 95/22.5 + 102.9); baked into the
  installer so a handoff refresh cannot regress them.
### Step 4 — the 10 pages re-skinned (differs identical)
- Class-gap scan drove the strategy: 99 old classes → (a) NARROW ports
  into 09-extensions (legal-doc · process-diagram minus connectors ·
  nested-FAQ children · review-card facts · team-card · utilities;
  token-only, skin guarantee recuts them), (b) MARKUP SWAPS onto new
  vocabulary (tldr__label · ai-summary container · grid-2/3 ·
  link-wrap+link-standalone for tiles/pills · review-card shells for
  service/guide cards · home compare table → REAL <table class=
  "vs-table"> with mark-yes/no + sr-only kept), (c) the two money-page
  FORMS rebuilt on the render shells (reskin_forms.py) with the LOCKED
  CONTRACT preserved exactly — services[] names, full option sets +
  values, hidden meta, trackers, honeypot. Real Clutch quotes + NAP
  replaced the render placeholders; review cards on the new
  __name/__role/__verified shape with the work/outcome fact lines kept.
- 08-additions CURATED (old per-round precedent): call-bar, proof-strip,
  breadcrumb, rule-mark kept; calculator/research/editorial/verdict/
  problem/TOC/byline families DROPPED until their pages build
  (KEEP_ADDITIONS in the installer). One stray handoff hex
  (#FFFFFF inverted-primary hover) tokenized to var(--bg-card); the
  css-drift checker is now comment-aware.
- FORM PROBES on the new shells: file-review (default BOFU meta +
  referrer fallback + override) and contact (default-empty · NEW-key
  CTA swap "Scope the Setup" · texas state path) — ALL GREEN, 24 keys.
- DIFFERS IDENTICAL: contact 13/0/24 · legal 16-18/0/22 ·
  partners 42/7/26 · trust 39/6/26 — same dispositions as round 8.
### Step 5 — NO-TRACES PROOF PASSED (verify_no_traces.py)
- Zero old-system hexes (oxblood/old-paper/old-focus, 10-hex sweep)
  across sources + minified artifact · zero classes outside
  MANIFEST(208) ∪ 09-extensions-defined ∪ semantic whitelist ·
  motif-ledger/old logos/inter font OUT of the output (sources archived
  in _build/archive/old-skin/ — no git). figure-judgment.svg KEPT —
  content diagram, currentColor recuts it to cobalt.
- 404 BUILT from pages/404.html → /404.html (minimal chrome, real
  silo links + NAP, noindex via new robotsOverride, nf-* styles
  tokenized in 09-extensions).
- BRAND SCHEMA: Organization.logo + Brand.logo → ImageObject
  icon-512.png (512×512) per BRAND-CHAIN.
### Step 6 — CTA LEXICON installed (src/_data/ctaLexicon.json + battery check)
- Canonical: "Book the discovery call" (primary) · "Get the free file
  review" · "Speak to a ProAdvisor" (phone) · "Read the methodology" /
  "See how it works" (soft) · "Get the file diagnosed" (problem).
- Sanctioned (registry, role-annotated): "Send the Discovery Brief"
  (baseline submit) · "Start the Application" / "Ask a Question First"
  (round-9 partner rulings) · "Explore Services" · "The Four Trust
  Pillars" (anchor) · "Back to the homepage" (404).
- intents.json per-intent cta values = fenced machinery, auto-sanctioned.
- MAPPED to canonical: home hero "Speak to a ProAdvisor"→"Book the
  discovery call" + "Get your file reviewed"→"Get the free file review" ·
  file-review "Submit your file for review"/"Submit for free
  review"→"Get the free file review" ×3 · all "Call (877) 751-5575"
  ghost buttons→"Speak to a ProAdvisor" (hrefs/intents untouched).
- Battery check `cta-lexicon` standing: 10 distinct labels, all green.
### State at the step-6 STOP
- Battery ALL GREEN (incl. content-equity ×7, cta-lexicon).
- CSS: minified 52,121 B / 59,392 B (7,271 B headroom) · source
  74,466 B. Manifest grep ready to become a standing battery check at
  step 7.

## ROUND 10 · BLOCK 1 — PROBE ANCHOR + SKIN TRANSPLANT + LAYOUT CONVERSION
- **Step 1**: pre-changeover computed-style anchor archived
  (_build/verify/css-probe-pre-changeover.txt, 20 fingerprints; its
  file-review@1280 cell holds the STABLE hash 2a94e234 — the round-9
  batch file carried unreproducible probe noise in that one cell).
- **Step 2 — transplant**: new handoff fetched + inventory COMPLETE
  (nothing missing). SKIN installed via the rewritten
  _build/extract_css.py (now the SKIN INSTALLER): 00-fonts/01-tokens
  verbatim · 02-base kept (locked floor) · 03-conversion · 04-chrome ·
  05-tiers (tier-common PORTED: fallback @font-face deduped) ·
  06-motif-rules · 07-motion (@view-transition stays commented) ·
  08-additions · 09-extensions (session file, empty at install).
  **R1 APPLIED + VERIFIED**: #2B4FD6→var(--accent), #3D63E8→
  var(--color-accent-soft) across motif-rules/tier-common/conversion,
  installer asserts zero leftovers; marks RENDER (BOFU hero rule +
  quick-5 underscores confirmed at full res). Cascade fix shipped: the
  motif-rules footer-disclosure override also clears 04-chrome's
  gradient (it would have painted the mark's gap). **R2**:
  skin-tokens-draft.css excluded (installer FORBIDDEN list; same for
  fonts-preview.css). **R3**: queued for the OG batch round.
  FONTS: publicsans-var + ibmplexmono-400/500/600 latin woff2
  downloaded (fetch_fonts_skin.py); fraunces pair carried over.
  METRIC OVERRIDES RE-VERIFIED against the binaries
  (verify_font_metrics.py, capsize method; both fonts USE_TYPO_METRICS):
  declared values corrected — Fraunces 97.8/25.5 + size-adjust 106.8,
  Public Sans 95/22.5 + 102.9 — baked into the installer.
  ICONS: 8 Lucide diffed vs official (diff_lucide.py): 5 match, 3 REAL
  DRIFTS (menu/phone/star) replaced with official geometry in the
  handoff styling frame. BRAND CHAIN: head per BRAND-CHAIN.md
  (theme-color #FBFAF7, favicon set, apple-touch, /site.webmanifest
  passthrough, preload swap inter→publicsans), logos installed, old
  marks archived. OLD SKIN ARCHIVED (not deleted — no git):
  _build/archive/old-skin/.
- **Step 3 — layouts**: five tier layouts REBUILT (t-hub/t-location dark
  hero + motif-align-full/-ny · t-mofu compact+call-bar · t-guide
  compact, no call-bar · t-bofu minimal chrome + hero--rule + call-bar)
  + chrome partials re-cut to 03-chrome vocabulary (util-bar, sticky
  header + dropdowns, drawer, dark footer with aligned-segment
  disclosure, minimal variants) — NAV/FOOTER LINK SET CARRIED VERBATIM.
  tb-nav.js selectors re-pointed (behavior contract unchanged) +
  is-scrolled state; NEW tb-callbar.js (auto-hide/reveal);
  .has-call-bar body class reserves space (zero CLS). CONTENT MACHINERY
  FENCED — tb-forms/tb-faq/intents/schema/form contract/section IDs
  untouched. Legal pages moved t-mofu→t-guide (call-bar never on
  legal); trust callBar:false (hub-structured page).
- **First build on the new skin: minified 53,432 B / 59,392 B gate
  (5,960 B headroom) · source 73,789 B.** Per-tier samples rendered on
  OUR layouts beside the Design renders:
  _build/verify/shots/changeover/<tier>-{OURS,DESIGN}.png.
- FLAGS: CLASS-MANIFEST gap — design renders use
  `section--cta-band--light` (semantic, no rules) but the 208-list
  omits it (whitelist or regenerate upstream) · `.section--alt` does
  not exist in the new system (10 built pages still reference it —
  step-4 mapping decision) · old icons/motifs/CSS-archive removal lands
  at step 5 by design.

## ROUND 9 — CSS DEEP TRIM (TODO 17 CLOSED) + round-8 audit rulings
Full report: _build/reports/round-9.md
### Round-8 audit rulings APPLIED
- ROUND 8 APPROVED (trust rewordings, partners retirements, retargets).
- NEW intent key `partner-apply` (additive): /partners/ "Start the
  Application" CTAs (hero, process, application-cta, cta-band, FAQ
  submit link) → /contact/?intent=partner-apply; "Ask a Question
  First" stays ?intent=partner-question.
- Two-mention ceiling EXEMPTION CLASS logged: TOPICAL PAGES (e.g.
  /trust/) alongside the support-silo exception (ruling 18).
### The trim (founder-ordered; pass condition = zero visual/behavioral change)
- **RESULTS: minified 59,313 → 56,092 B (−3,221; headroom now 3,300 B
  under the 59,392 B gate — target ≥2,048 ✓) · source 88,646 → 74,975 B
  (−13,671; under the 75 KB target ✓; still over the 70 KB soft-cap,
  flagged as designed).**
- Per-file source savings: 03-components −5,134 (unused-rule DROP list
  + banner-only comments via extract_css.py) · 07-extensions −4,747
  (comment collapse + .initials-mark/.section-motif removal — dead
  since the round-7 photo wiring / never composed) · 05-kit −1,964
  (.disclosure + .hero--editorial de-curated; return via the extractor
  when the support silo / editorial pages build) · 06-chrome −1,197 ·
  00-fonts −629 · 01-tokens + 02-base LOCKED, untouched (≈870 B of
  unused rules + 6.1 KB comments left on the table pending TODO 7
  ratification).
- Levers: css_audit.py unused-selector proof (JS-injected classes
  whitelisted) · extract_css.py DROP_TOKENS_03/_05 + banner-only
  comment policy (regeneration reproduces the trimmed size) ·
  trim_session_css.py for session files · LF-only line endings (CRLF
  was costing ~1 B/line on disk) · round-8's :is() compaction stands.
### ZERO-DRIFT PROOF (new factory capability)
- css_probe.ps1 / css_probe_all.ps1: per-page hash of getComputedStyle
  for EVERY element (+::before/::after), fonts awaited, custom-property
  enumeration SORTED (Chrome enumerates them nondeterministically —
  diagnosed via css_probe_diag/props scripts). 10 pages × 2 viewports
  (1280/360) = 20 fingerprints.
- **Before/after: 20/20 IDENTICAL.** (One batch-run outlier on
  file-review@1280 was unreproducible probe noise — two consecutive
  re-probes returned the baseline hash exactly.)
### Round-9 verification
- Battery 33 checks ALL GREEN on the trimmed bundle (links 889 ·
  content-equity ×7 · css-bytes 56,092/59,392).
- Overflow spot-probes home / file-review / trust: 349/379/753 —
  identical to pre-trim.
- Lighthouse desktop post-trim: home a11y 100 · BP 100 · SEO 100 ·
  CLS 0 · perf 49 host-limited / file-review same quality · CLS 0 ·
  perf 52 / trust same quality · CLS 0 · perf 64 (benchmarkIndex
  120–166; go-remote gate item 4 stands).
- Prod build from clean: 9 pages, dev/* excluded, env fail-closed ✓.
### Scripts added (no-one-liner rule)
css_audit.py · css_probe.ps1 · css_probe_all.ps1 · css_probe_diag.ps1 ·
css_probe_props.ps1 · trim_session_css.py (+ extract_css.py round-9
trim logic). The probe pair is now the standing zero-drift harness for
ANY future CSS-touching round — and the regression-proof tool for the
upcoming design-system changeover.

## ROUND 8 — FIRST ELEVATION BATCH (6 pages) + round-7 audit rulings
Full report (standalone, with OPEN ITEMS): _build/reports/round-8.md
### Round-7 audit rulings APPLIED
- Elevation pattern APPROVED. /contact/ removals SIGNED OFF.
- CHROME-RELOCATED differ class implemented (equity-exceptions.json
  entries carry type chrome|removal; battery + equity_report.py report
  them separately; chrome class needs no per-page sign-off).
- Calendly FAQ #7 placement KEEP — flag closed.
- OG images → single auto-generated batch round before go-remote
  (GO-REMOTE GATE ITEM 6). TODO 9 re-pointed.
- Report rule EXTENDED: round reports are standalone files ending with
  an "OPEN ITEMS / STOPPED AT" section.
### Pages elevated (all URLs byte-identical, differ GREEN each)
| Page | Tier/tint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| /legal/disclaimer/ | t-mofu · guide · chrome:full | legal-doc carried VERBATIM (header/meta/summary/TOC/sections, ids #sec-1…) |
| /legal/dpa/ | same | verbatim carry |
| /legal/privacy-policy/ | same | verbatim carry — the /legal/privacy/ dead-link sweep landed this round (see below) |
| /legal/terms/ | same | verbatim carry |
| /trust/ | t-mofu · HUB tint · chrome:full | full standing pattern; live page already carried quick-5+FAQ architecture — carried; 3 quick-5 questions REWORDED (answers verbatim; originals live verbatim in FAQ) to satisfy zero-overlap — SIGN-OFF REQUESTED |
| /partners/ | t-mofu · guide · chrome:full | nested FAQ (6 parents + 13 children) carried verbatim; NEW additive quick-5; FAQPage now mirrors the accordion (live schema NEVER matched rendered — defect class; 5 schema-only questions retired, SIGN-OFF REQUESTED) |
- Ported by _build/scripts/port_legal.py (legal ×4, generated njk +
  verbatim page JSON-LD) and hand-composed trust/partners from existing
  components ONLY (zero new component CSS for those two).
- Legal pages SKIP the Q/A architecture per founder ruling 16 (legal
  text is not Q/A content). Trust + partners carry the full pattern.
### LIVE DEFECTS found/fixed this round
- /legal/privacy/ dead-link SWEEP (founder-ordered): live carriers =
  contact (fixed round 7) + /quickbooks/speak-to-a-quickbooks-expert/
  (fix lands when that page elevates). No other carriers.
- /partners/ live dead links ×3 (never-built URLs): /partners/apply/ →
  /contact/?intent=partner-question · /partners/benefits/ →
  #partners-benefits · /partners/requirements/ → #partners-requirements.
  RETARGETS NEED SIGN-OFF; founder may prefer a partner-apply intent
  key or queueing /partners/apply/.
- /partners/ FAQPage schema/rendered mismatch (see table above).
- /trust/ editorial-break referenced /assets/img/services/
  trust-editorial-*.webp — assets DO NOT EXIST in the repo. Decorative
  aria-hidden section OMITTED; sharp pipeline ready when real imagery
  arrives.
### CSS
- Gate stress: legal-doc + breadcrumb extensions initially broke the
  58 KB gate (fail-closed worked: build refused at 59,840 B). Trim
  executed per ruling-2 condition (a): prose-link affordance compacted
  with :is() (~0.9 KB minified saved), legal-doc eyebrow rules merged.
- Final: minified 59,313 B / 59,392 B — **79 B headroom** ⚠ CRITICAL:
  next CSS-touching round MUST deep-trim first (gate does NOT move).
  Source 88,646 B (soft-cap flagged; trim target <75 KB stands).
- New tokenized extensions: .breadcrumb (ported from design 04-pages) ·
  .legal-doc system (design's .page--legal placeholder filled — upstream
  pending). faq__children/nested vocabulary already existed in
  03-components (zero cost).
### Battery upgrades this round
- content-equity: chrome-relocated class + FAQ-level exceptions.
- faq detection now matches faq__list--nested (partners' nested FAQ was
  silently skipped on first run — caught and fixed; all FAQ checks now
  fire on nested pages).
### Round-8 verification
- Battery 33 checks ALL GREEN (incl. content-equity ×7 pages: contact
  13/13 · disclaimer 16/16 · dpa 18/18 · privacy 18/18 · terms 18/18 ·
  partners 42/42 headings + 7/7 FAQ · trust 39/39 headings + 6/6 FAQ).
- 889 hrefs across 10 preview pages all resolve.
- Overflow 360/390/768: all 6 new pages clean (345-349/375-379/753).
- Lighthouse desktop: /trust/ a11y 100 · BP 100 · SEO 100 · CLS 0
  (one CLS regression found at 0.008 — hero <strong> font-swap shift —
  fixed by dropping inline bold from the hero subheading, text verbatim)
  · perf 48 host-limited. /legal/privacy-policy/ a11y 100 · BP 100 ·
  SEO 100 · CLS 0 · perf 79 host-limited (benchmarkIndex 114–174; gate
  item 4 stands).
- Screenshots: 6 pages desktop-full + mobile-360 — _build/verify/shots/.
- Word counts (built main vs baseline whole-page): disclaimer 1,311/1,653
  · dpa 1,245/1,587 · privacy 1,324/1,666 · terms 1,253/1,595 · trust
  2,061/2,397 · partners 2,623/2,715 — deltas ≈ the excluded newsletter
  band + legacy footer text counted in baseline whole-page numbers;
  content itself verbatim per differ.
### Round-8 flags needing founder ruling (full list in report OPEN ITEMS)
1. Trust quick-5 rewordings (3) · 2. Partners schema-question
retirements (5) · 3. Partners dead-link retargets (3) + apply-CTA
target · 4. Trust editorial imagery (assets missing) · 5. TRUST PAGE vs
TWO-MENTION CEILING: the trust page's baseline content carries ~6
independence mentions (its core topic) — equity carried; ceiling
exemption requested (like support silo) · 6. CSS 79 B headroom.
### Scripts added (no-one-liner rule)
port_legal.py · verify_round8.ps1 (batch overflow+shots) ·
equity_report.py gained CHROME-RELOCATED labeling.

## ROUND 7 — RULINGS APPLIED + /contact/ ELEVATED (T-BOFU)
### Ruling 1 APPLIED — sharp pipeline + David photo (TODO 14 CLOSED)
- @11ty/eleventy-img installed; `{% photo %}` async shortcode in
  eleventy.config.cjs: AVIF/WebP/JPEG, explicit width/height (CLS 0),
  loading=lazy default (`eager: true` opt-in for above-fold), alt
  REQUIRED (build fails without). Sources stay where the founder drops
  them; generated variants → /assets/img/generated/ (hashed names).
- david-westgate.jpg wired into the homepage team card through the
  pipeline (initials mark replaced). 9 variants generated from the
  212,156 B source: **64w AVIF 1,616 B (the 1× fetch) · 128w AVIF
  2,651 B (2×) · 192w AVIF 3,712 B · JPEG fallback 2,187–8,470 B** —
  ~99% smaller than the source at 1×. CSS: `.team-card picture`
  flex-shrink guard (+1 rule). Lighthouse home re-run: **CLS 0 with
  the photo live** — explicit-dims guarantee holds. Visual proof:
  shots/home-team-card.png.
### Ruling 2 APPLIED — CSS hard gate 55KB → 58KB (TODO 15 CLOSED)
- Gate now 59,392 B in BOTH enforcement points (eleventy.config.cjs
  build-fail + run_battery.py); extract_css.py label corrected (it
  reports source bytes; the gate is minified-artifact).
- Conditions logged per ruling: (a) SOURCE TRIM PASS is a scheduled
  task during silo elevation — execute tracker trim candidates
  (06-chrome/07-extensions comment condensing), target source back
  under 75 KB; (b) **58 KB is the ceiling through cutover — the gate
  does not move again.**
### TODO 5 CLOSED — all 11 unmapped intent keys resolved (pre-contact)
- Added to intents.json (additive, `_added`-marked, canonical pricing
  from the live tier pages): qb-faq · quickbooks · quickbooks-plan ·
  quickbooks-proadvisor · quickbooks-setup-{essentials $750–1.5K,
  standard $1.5–3K, complex $3–5K+} · quickbooks-migration-{simple
  from $2.5K, standard from $4.5K, complex from $7.5K} · techbrot-fit.
- New scout: _build/scripts/scout_intents.py (live-HTML intent scan vs
  registry, state-lookup aware). Result: **106/106 live intent keys
  mapped, zero unmapped.**
### Ruling 3 APPLIED — /contact/ ELEVATED (first baseline-page elevation)
- **Page**: src/contact.njk + contact.11tydata.js → /contact/ (URL
  byte-identical). T-BOFU layout, chrome:minimal, bofu tint. 1,396
  rendered words (baseline 951 — enriched, not gutted).
- **Sequence (10)**: contact-{hero · in-brief · tldr (bofu tint, body
  id=#contact-promise — the BASELINE SPEAKABLE selector preserved) ·
  ai-summary (quick-5 ruled) · expect (3-step process-diagram, live
  "What to expect" steps verbatim) · trust (5 "Why owners choose"
  bullets verbatim incl. disclaimer link + Direct contact / HQ cards) ·
  main (THE FORM, #contact-discovery-form) · alt (4 channels verbatim:
  Calendly / phone / partners / press) · faq (7 NEW buyer-objection
  Q/As) · cta (layout)}.
- **Baseline equity accounting** (battery check `content-equity`, NEW —
  see below): 13/13 baseline headings present or justified · H1, meta
  description, canonical, ContactPage + BreadcrumbList schema nodes
  (incl. og image ref + #contact-promise speakable) VERBATIM · live
  form contract reproduced: field names, services[] values+order+help
  lines, select options, consent text, "Send the Discovery Brief"
  label, ALL-EMPTY hidden meta defaults (live semantic — contact takes
  its meaning from URL params/referrer). JUSTIFIED REMOVALS (founder
  sign-off requested): "The monthly brief." newsletter section (round-4
  ruling: /subscribe unverified, no dead forms ship) + 4 legacy footer
  column headings (chrome:minimal per round-4 chrome variant rule).
  BSS title artifact stripped (TODO 4 applied for this page).
- **LIVE DEFECT fixed at elevation**: live consent + FAQ linked
  /legal/privacy/ — a URL that has NEVER existed (real page:
  /legal/privacy-policy/). Battery `links` caught it; elevation links
  the real page. Recorded alongside TODO 3's defect class.
- **Form probes** (_build/verify/form-payload-contact.json, 3 cases):
  default → all meta empty, source_page=referrer fallback, 24 keys ✓ ·
  ?intent=quickbooks-setup-standard (NEW key) → CTA "Scope the Setup",
  services=["qb-setup"] auto-checked ✓ · ?intent=texas → state-lookup
  __state_pillar__ path, CTA "Book the Discovery Call",
  services=["not-sure"] ✓. GA4 lead_submit/phone_click wired,
  console-only outside production.
- Quick-5 (contact): How fast does TechBrot respond? · What happens
  after I send the discovery brief? · Do I have to commit to anything
  on the call? · What should I put in the brief? · Where is TechBrot
  headquartered?
- FAQ (7, FAQPage verbatim, zero overlap, phone ≤2): discovery call
  cost? · sales pitch on the call? · not the right fit? · only
  QuickBooks businesses? · pricing after the call? · marketing list? ·
  urgent — skip the form? *(phone + Calendly)*
- New CSS (tokenized): .intake-checkbox__help · .intake-group__note ·
  .intake-field__optional · .intake-form__reassurance (live form's
  visible help/optional/reassurance text — baseline content).
  site.json emails gained hello@ + press@ (live page values).
### NEW BATTERY CHECK — content-equity differ (risk hierarchy #2, now enforced)
- run_battery.py check 8: for every built URL present in the FROZEN
  baseline — every baseline heading, FAQ Q/A, and schema node type must
  be present in the built page OR carry a founder-justified entry in
  _build/battery/equity-exceptions.json. Justified removals are
  REPORTED every round, never silent. First enforcement: /contact/
  GREEN (13 headings · 0 FAQ · 24 schema types accounted).
### Round-7 verification (full battery + probes, all on current build)
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Battery (19 checks incl. content-equity) | ✅ ALL GREEN |
| url-set / links / intents / founder-zero / css-drift | ✅ (251 hrefs across 4 preview pages resolve) |
| css-bytes | ✅ minified 56,642 B / 59,392 B gate (2,750 B headroom) · source 84,652 B ⚠ over soft-cap (trim pass scheduled per ruling 2) |
| Δ vs round 6 | +544 B minified (+983 B source): picture guard + form help/note/optional/reassurance |
| content-equity (/contact/) | ✅ 13 headings · 24 schema types · justified removals reported |
| overflow 360/390/768 (contact + home) | ✅ 349/379/753 — clean |
| Lighthouse desktop /contact/ | a11y 100 · BP 100 · SEO 100 · CLS 0 · perf 68 host-limited (benchmarkIndex 174; gate item 4) |
| Lighthouse desktop / (photo live) | a11y 100 · BP 100 · SEO 100 · **CLS 0** · perf 60 host-limited |
| Form payload proof | ✅ 3 probes (default / new key / state lookup) — form-payload-contact.json |
| Screenshots | contact desktop full / hero / mobile-360 + home-team-card (photo proof) — _build/verify/shots/ |
| Prod build from clean | ✅ 3 pages, dev/* excluded, env fail-closed intact |
### Round-7 scripts added (no-one-liner rule)
scout_intents.py · form_probe_contact.ps1 · screenshots-contact.ps1 ·
shot_anchor.ps1 (fragment-scrolled screenshots) · lighthouse-page.ps1
(added in the round-6 re-verify, reused here).

## ROUND 6 — HOMEPAGE MICRO-FIX + /quickbooks/file-review/ (T-BOFU #1)
### Homepage micro-fix (quick-5 oxblood rule scope)
- `.ai-summary--ruled` rule moved from `.ai-summary__item` (whole row,
  question + answer) to `.ai-summary__question` ONLY. Answer text now
  sits clean with no rule. Component-level CSS edit in 07-extensions.css
  — applies to the quick-5 pattern SITEWIDE (homepage today,
  file-review this round, every future page with the .ai-summary--ruled
  variant). Visual proof: home-quick5-fixed-desktop.png shot.

### /quickbooks/file-review/ — T-BOFU page (Sheet 8 BOFU priority #1)
- **Page**: src/quickbooks/file-review.njk + file-review.11tydata.js
  → permalink /quickbooks/file-review/ → renders as
  _site-prod/quickbooks/file-review/index.html. Intent key
  `file-review` added to intents.json (canonical key — every
  problem/symptom/error CTA converges here; today the homepage's hero
  ghost CTA is the first live consumer via `?intent=home`).
- **Layout**: NEW src/_includes/layouts/t-bofu.njk · chrome: minimal
  (logo + phone only, slim footer — no funnel leakage) · `.hero--compact`
  with 48×3 oxblood hairline accent (::before, design 05-kit §BOFU) ·
  ledger-bofu surface (--surface-tier-bofu, paper-deep #ECEAE2) on
  TL;DR + cta-band. Reusable for every future T-BOFU endpoint.
- **Page sequence (10 sections)** — file-review-{hero · in-brief · tldr
  (bofu tint, speakable-paired) · ai-summary (5 BOFU Q/A, ruled
  variant) · checks (6-row ledger list, NEW .checks-list extension) ·
  process (4-step .process-diagram reuse) · trust (4 trust-row items +
  2 verified Clutch cards) · form (full intake-form, intent=file-review
  default) · faq (7 buyer-objection Q/As, accordion, FAQPage verbatim)
  · cta (slim band, layout-supplied)}.
### THE FORM (the page's engine)
- form-contract.json payload reproduced EXACTLY (24 keys + services
  array + industry overwrite quirk). Captured proof:
  _build/verify/form-payload-file-review.json.
- HTML defaults set: `intent=file-review`, `source_type=bofu-conversion`,
  `funnel_stage=BOFU` (others empty; source_page intentionally
  empty so the live-engine semantic — URL param > document.referrer >
  empty — is preserved).
- **tb-forms.js round-6 change**: intent engine's data-meta loop
  changed from unconditional `el.value = meta[k]` to
  `if (meta[k]) el.value = meta[k]` — empty URL params no longer
  WIPE HTML defaults. The collect() loop still writes ALL data-meta
  fields to the payload "ALWAYS" — form-contract.json contract
  preserved. Verified with two probes:
  - DEFAULT URL (no params) → payload.intent = "file-review",
    source_type = "bofu-conversion", funnel_stage = "BOFU", services = [].
  - ?intent=cleanup&state=texas → payload.intent = "cleanup",
    state = "texas", services = ["cleanup"] (engine auto-checks per
    intents.json MAP["cleanup"].service); BOFU defaults preserved.
- Honeypot `company_website` present + sr-only + NOT in payload.
- GA4 lead_submit + phone_click wired via tbTrack; disabled outside
  production (console-only).
### CSS budget — INTAKE FORM CSS BACK IN BUNDLE
- Re-added to 07-extensions.css as a tokenized port from the design's
  03-components (lines ~2685–3050 form system + 4198–4373 success/error).
  The Part B drift block (29 hardcoded hex flagged in round 1) was
  re-tokenized AA-clean — accent / text-primary / border-hairline /
  bg-card / text-secondary / accent-tinted rgba. Trimmed to fit the
  hard gate: dropped intake-form__header/__eyebrow/__heading/__lede
  (form uses generic .section__header above the form instead), dropped
  the success-panel entrance animation and reduced-motion media (motion
  tokens already zero on the design token layer), dropped
  intake-checkbox--consent overrides and :has(input:checked) outer-card
  state. Result: form is fully styled, success panel + error states
  re-tokenized and present.
- **BYTE REPORT (vs ratified 55 KB hard gate)**:
  - minified: 56,098 B / 56,320 B hard gate · **headroom 222 B** ⚠ TIGHT
  - source: 83,675 B · over 70 KB soft-cap (flagged; soft-cap was
    already over from round 5)
  - Delta from round 5: +6,369 B minified (was 49,729 B → now 56,098 B).
  - Hard gate held, but with under 0.5% headroom. Next CSS-touching
    round needs a trim before adding net new selectors, or the
    founder may want to ratify a budget bump (e.g., 58 KB minified)
    to make /contact/ and the T-MOFU/T-GUIDE work breathe. **Flagged
    for ruling; this round stays under the existing gate.**
### JSON-LD @graph (file-review.11tydata.js)
- WebPage (speakable: #file-review-tldr-body + #file-review-in-brief-text)
- BreadcrumbList: Home → QuickBooks → File review
- Service (#service-file-review): "Free QuickBooks File Review",
  serviceType, areaServed=US, BusinessAudience, offers: Offer with
  price="0" priceCurrency=USD availability=InStock; provider = global
  Organization @id (#organization)
- FAQPage: 7 Q/A VERBATIM from the rendered accordion (battery
  `faq-schema-verbatim` GREEN)
- NO AggregateRating (under-5 rule stands)
### Quick-5 questions (file-review)
1. What is a QuickBooks file review?
2. What does the review cost?
3. How long does the review take?
4. What do you need from me?
5. Is my data safe?
### FAQ questions (file-review, accordion, FAQPage verbatim)
1. What if the review uncovers more problems than I expected?
2. Will I get pressured to buy ongoing monthly bookkeeping?
3. Can I just talk to a ProAdvisor on the phone first? *(phone in answer)*
4. We're a multi-entity or multi-year situation — does the free review still apply?
5. Is the written fixed-fee scope binding?
6. Who actually reviews the file?
7. What happens if you tell me the file is fine? *(phone in answer)*

Zero overlap with quick-5 (battery `faq-overlap` GREEN).
### Strategic in-body interlinks (chrome:minimal compensation)
TL;DR + F2 + F7 weave: /accounting/bookkeeping/cleanup-bookkeeping/?intent=cleanup
· /catch-up-bookkeeping/?intent=catch-up · /monthly-bookkeeping/?intent=monthly
· /quickbooks/. Every page CTA routes to #file-review-form or tel:.
### Round-6 verification (full battery + probes — RE-RUN 2026-06-13 after reboot)
The 2026-06-12 reboot hit during the final battery pass, AFTER the last
source edit (22:53: file-review source_page HTML default → empty, so the
live-engine semantic URL param > referrer > empty is preserved) but with
_site-prod, Lighthouse, and screenshots still built from the 22:34
pre-edit state. 2026-06-13: prod artifact rebuilt from clean and the
ENTIRE battery re-run on the current source — all artifacts in
_build/verify/ now post-date the final edit. The only page delta between
stale and current artifacts was that one hidden input (invisible).
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Battery (14 checks across home + file-review) | ✅ ALL GREEN |
| url-set | ✅ 3 URLs (home, file-review, dev/form-test) all in baseline∪queue (dev/* preview-only; prod output = 2 pages) |
| links | ✅ 219 hrefs across 3 pages all resolve |
| intents | ✅ all CTA intents in intents.json; 2 page intent keys unique |
| founder-zero | ✅ visible content clean |
| css-drift | ✅ zero hardcoded hex, zero undeclared vars in bundle |
| css-bytes | ✅ 56,098 B / 56,320 B (222 B headroom) ⚠ source 83,675 B over 70 KB soft-cap |
| ai-summary-5 (home + file-review) | ✅ exactly 5 Q/A each |
| faq-min-6 (home + file-review) | ✅ 7 FAQ items each |
| faq-overlap (home + file-review) | ✅ zero overlap each |
| faq-schema-verbatim (home + file-review) | ✅ 7 Q/A match accordion verbatim each |
| overflow 360 / 390 / 768 | ✅ file-review AND home: scrollW 349 / 379 / 753 — clean, zero overflow |
| Lighthouse desktop (file-review, fresh prod artifact, 2 runs) | a11y 100 / BP 100 / SEO 100 / CLS 0 · all failing audits performance-only · perf 29–32 at benchmarkIndex 77–90 (host much slower post-reboot than the 2026-06-12 run: perf 58 @ benchmarkIndex 192). Quality categories identical across all runs; perf NOT calibrated on this host — go-remote gate item 4 stands |
| Form payload proof | ✅ RE-CAPTURED both probes into _build/verify/form-payload-file-review.json: default (intent=file-review · source_type=bofu-conversion · funnel_stage=BOFU · services=[] · source_page=referrer fallback ✓ proves the 22:53 fix) + override ?intent=cleanup&state=texas (intent=cleanup · state=texas · services=["cleanup"] auto-checked · BOFU defaults preserved). 24 contract keys + services array. Known artifact quirk: _page_url shows `&amp;` — Chrome --dump-dom serialization escape during capture, not a page bug |
| Skin guarantee | ✅ css-drift zero |
| Screenshots | RE-SHOT on current build: file-review desktop full / hero desktop / mobile-360 + home-quick5 micro-fix (rule under question only, verified visually) — _build/verify/shots/ |

New named scripts this pass (founder no-one-liner rule):
_build/scripts/lighthouse-page.ps1 (parameterized page audit) ·
screenshots-file-review.ps1 · form_probe.ps1 (dual payload probe,
writes the form-payload artifact).

### DAVID PHOTO — flag (NOT wired this round; needs founder call)
- `assets/people/david-westgate.jpg` IS NOW ON DISK (212 KB JPG,
  written 2026-06-08). Round 5 logged "NOT present on disk" — that
  flag is OUT OF DATE.
- Standing order: "wire it with sharp the moment it exists." The
  sharp pipeline does NOT exist yet (round 4 deferred to "first
  image arrives"). Wiring inline without sharp would ship a raw
  212 KB JPG on the homepage, which would hurt LCP/perf on mobile
  and conflict with the standing order's intent.
- **Action**: KEEPING the typographic initials mark on the homepage
  team card this round. Two paths for the founder to pick:
  1. Build the sharp pipeline next round (Eleventy Image plugin,
     `{% photo %}` shortcode AVIF/WebP/JPEG with explicit dims) —
     proper standing-order compliance, also unblocks editorial-break
     slots.
  2. Ship inline `<img>` with explicit dims + lazy load as a deliberate
     interim, accept the perf hit, plan sharp upgrade for a later round.
- Until founder rules: David photo stays on the FLAG list (now with the
  correct on-disk state).

### Go-remote gate — item 2 CLOSED
- /quickbooks/file-review/ BUILT, verified, all CTAs that point at it
  no longer 404. Go-remote blockers remaining: item 1 (preview-header
  proof on Cloudflare), item 3 (TEST-MIGRATION-2026 live form POST),
  item 4 (Lighthouse re-verification on calibrated infra), item 5
  (`npm run build:prod` from clean — already proven each round).

## ROUND 5 — REFINEMENT (founder rulings + homepage)
### Rulings closed
1. **CSS BUDGET RATIFIED:** hard gate = minified ≤55KB (shipping artifact);
   source soft-cap 70KB, flagged never blocking. This round: minified
   49,729B / 56,320B (6.4KB headroom) · source 75,095B — OVER the 70KB
   soft-cap (flagged; FAQ family +7.4KB and guides +1.7KB drove it; next
   trim opportunity: comment condensing in 06-chrome/07-extensions).
2. **3 GUIDE URLS LOCKED** in build-new-queue.json + linked from
   #home-guides: /resources/guides/{quickbooks-cleanup, hire-a-bookkeeper,
   bookkeeping-rates}/ — T-GUIDE work, **GO-REMOTE BLOCKERS**.
3. **BUTTON COLOR CLOSED:** shipped system wins — ink-at-rest, oxblood
   hover.
### STANDING RULE — per-page Q/A architecture (sitewide)
- Quick-5 (.ai-summary--ruled, NY oxblood-left-rule pattern) sits DIRECTLY
  BELOW the TL;DR. AI-extraction layer; speakable-paired; OUT of FAQPage.
- Bottom FAQ accordion (#<slug>-faq, design .faq component) after
  framework/trust, before cta-band: 6–8 buyer-objection Q/As, one open at
  a time, panels crawlable when closed (grid-rows animation, motion
  tokens, reduced-motion honored). FAQPage JSON-LD carries the ACCORDION
  verbatim — one FAQPage per page. Phone-in-answers: ≤2 natural placements.
- ZERO OVERLAP between quick-5 and FAQ questions.
- Battery enforces all of it: ai-summary-5 · faq-min-6 · faq-overlap ·
  faq-schema-verbatim (schema == rendered text, entity-normalized).
### STANDING RULE — tier surfaces (final table)
| Tier | Surface token | Value |
|---|---|---|
| T-HUB | --surface-tier-hub | paper-mist #F7F5F0 |
| T-LOCATION | --surface-tier-hub | (approved: hub tint) |
| T-MOFU | --surface-tier-guide | paper-warm #F3F1EB |
| T-GUIDE | --surface-tier-guide | paper-warm #F3F1EB |
| T-BOFU | --surface-tier-bofu | paper-deep #ECEAE2 |
Application: TL;DR section + final cta-band sit on the tier surface;
cta-band light variant re-inks text, tier class supplies surface.
### STANDING RULE — prose link affordance (WCAG 1.4.1)
Prose links: whisper hairline underline at rest (ink-faint, 1px, 3px
offset) → accent color on hover/focus. Nav/buttons/card-list links exempt.
(Interpretation note: rest indicator is a full-width hairline; the 60→100
width animation remains the .btn--text treatment — text-decoration cannot
width-animate multiline safely.)
### Homepage changes
- Quick-5 relocated below TL;DR, ruled style; FAQ accordion added (7 Q/As;
  phone CTA in #1 cost and #6 multi-year answers); learning-center
  restored (3 locked guide URLs); industry tiles now TEXT-ONLY (Lucide
  removed there; remains sanctioned for table marks + future contact
  icons); team: lead-practice card carries the real italic-t logo mark.
- **DAVID PHOTO FLAG:** assets/people/david-westgate.jpg NOT present on
  disk (chat-attached image is not a file source). Card keeps typographic
  initials per ruling E fallback — drop the file in and it wires next
  round. Old source for the record: none — the card has only ever used
  initials "DW", no image was ever referenced.
- Diagram upgrade: judgment SVG 1,614B → 3,279B (period nodes, recon arcs,
  value gridlines, drift step, baseline ticks, double rule); process
  diagram + double-rule markers & junction dots (+~0.4KB CSS).
### Round-5 verification
Battery 10/10 GREEN (incl. new FAQ checks; schema-verbatim validated) ·
overflow probe 349/379/753 clean · Lighthouse a11y 100 / BP 100 / SEO 100,
zero failing audits · CLS 0 · accordion keyboard live-verified (one-at-a-
time, Escape + focus return, closed panels crawlable) · 1,957 rendered
words · founder-name-zero · skin guarantee (css-drift zero) · section
order (18): hero · in-brief · tldr · ai-summary · services · judgment ·
start · process · reviews · team · compare · industries · guides · states
· framework · trust · faq · cta. (Spec said 19 — actual is 18 with
in-brief counted; no section from the spec is missing.)

## ROUND 4 — HOMEPAGE FINAL BUILD
### Chrome (nav/footer TODO #1 CLOSED)
- NY-page chrome pattern ported as system components in 06-chrome.css
  (12.7KB source): util-bar · sticky .site-header with dropdown menus
  (button-toggled, aria-expanded, Escape/outside-click close) · mobile
  drawer (dialog, accordions, focus return, scroll lock) · dark
  .site-footer (brand col + 4 sitemap columns + disclosure + legal).
  Behavior in tb-nav.js (2.6KB, deferred, full-chrome pages only).
- **CHROME VARIANT RULE (standing):** `chrome: full` default — full nav +
  full footer. `chrome: minimal` for T-BOFU conversion endpoints
  (/contact/, /quickbooks/file-review/, future /book-a-call/): logo +
  phone header, slim footer (NAP + disclaimer + Privacy/Terms), no nav
  links = no funnel leakage. T-BOFU layout will default minimal. Verified
  on the dev harness page (chrome: minimal).
- Footer carries the MANDATORY trademark disclaimer — site chrome is
  exempt from the page two-mention ceiling (founder ruling). Newsletter
  band from the legacy footer EXCLUDED (/subscribe endpoint unverified —
  no dead forms ship).
### Standing ruling A — AI-SUMMARY IS ALWAYS FIVE
- Every page with the section: exactly 5 page-specific Q/A pairs, FAQPage
  schema pairs all five. Battery check `ai-summary-5` enforces ==5.
  Homepage: 5 built (incl. the two new: "Who is TechBrot for?", "What
  makes TechBrot different?"); FAQPage @graph node added (dump|safe).
  NO AggregateRating (under 5 reviews — rule stands; visible 5.0 display
  only, founder-supplied verified Clutch data).
### Standing ruling B — TIER-CODED SECTION SURFACES (tokens only)
- New tokens: --color-paper-mist #F7F5F0 (ONE new step interpolated
  inside the warm paper ramp) · --surface-tier-hub: paper-mist ·
  --surface-tier-bofu: paper-deep #ECEAE2 · --surface-tier-guide:
  paper-warm #F3F1EB. Changing the three tier tokens re-skins every page
  of that tier (skin guarantee holds).
- T-HUB applied: TL;DR + final cta-band on --surface-tier-hub; NO dark
  band on hub final-cta (dark = hero only). Light variant
  .section--cta-band--light re-inks text; the tier class supplies the
  surface. Verified: page dark surfaces = hero + footer chrome only.
- CONTRAST (WCAG, computed): on hub mist — primary 18.06 · body 13.20 ·
  secondary 6.36 · accent 8.82. On guide warm — 17.43/12.73/6.13/8.51.
  On bofu deep — 16.34/11.94/5.75/7.98. All AA+ (≥4.5). Btn paper-on-
  oxblood 9.19.
- **PROPOSAL (awaiting founder):** T-LOCATION → --surface-tier-hub
  (location pages are structurally hubs: dark hero + motif); T-MOFU →
  --surface-tier-guide (mid-funnel editorial kinship). If full
  distinction wanted, a 4th paper step is needed — say the word.
- NOTE: the design's .btn--primary is INK-bodied with oxblood hover
  (03-components truth); the brief §5 text says "oxblood". On the light
  band buttons render the system primary (ink). If oxblood-at-rest is
  wanted, that's an upstream component change — flag to ratify.
### Visual layer
- Process diagram: .process-diagram (extension) composing the design's
  .process-step — oxblood 2px phase markers, connecting hairlines, mono
  tabular numerals. Reusable on every service page.
- Judgment figure: partials/figure-judgment.svg — ledger-language inline
  SVG (720×220 explicit, currentColor, aria-hidden; flat drifting
  automation line w/ error ticks vs rising reconciled judgment line w/
  check marks + double ledger rule). In .ledger-figure component.
- Lucide icons (readme substitution policy): 8 inline-copied at
  stroke 1.5, 18px, currentColor — src/_includes/icons/ (3.5KB total).
- Comparison marks: .mark-yes/.mark-no CSS-drawn (no emoji/icon font)
  with .sr-only text equivalents.
- **EDITORIAL-BREAK SLOTS OPEN, AWAITING FOUNDER IMAGERY** — no real
  warm-toned documentary images exist in repo assets; nothing
  placeholder/stock shipped. sharp pipeline still pending first image.
### Content merge (sections as built, in order)
home-hero · home-in-brief · home-tldr (hub tint) · home-services ·
home-judgment (3 cards + figure) · home-start (6 buyer cards, intents:
cleanup, catch-up, monthly, qb-help*, quickbooks-setup, fractional-cfo —
*qb-help ADDED to intents.json additively; spec's qb-setup/cfo mapped to
EXISTING registry keys per "never duplicate") · home-process (diagram) ·
home-reviews (merged proof: 5.0 header + 2 verified Clutch cards,
founder-supplied) · home-team (initials marks, David Westgate operator
block + Intuit directory link) · home-compare (why-network table, honest
cells — solo bookkeeper concedes "named operator") · home-industries
(8 Lucide tiles + all-industries) · home-states (21 pills, all
repo/queue-verified) · home-ai-summary (5) · home-framework ·
home-trust · home-cta (light, hub tint).
### CSS BUDGET AMENDMENT (RATIFICATION NEEDED)
- The mandated scope cannot fit readable source in 55KB. Gate changed:
  **HARD gate = minified site.min.css ≤55KB (shipped artifact); source
  overage reported as flag.** This round: minified 43,016B / 56,320B
  (13.3KB headroom) · source 65,335B (flagged over).
- INTAKE FORM CSS (8.7KB) dropped from bundle this round — returns when
  file-review//contact/ builds. Dev harness functional unstyled-intake.
- Byte costs this round: chrome +12.7KB src · extensions +8.0KB src ·
  buyer/process/why-network/locations/industries sections +8.4KB src ·
  icons 3.5KB (HTML-inline) · judgment SVG 1.4KB · tb-nav.js 2.6KB.
### Round-4 flags/fixes (battery- or audit-caught)
- sr-only labels escaped the comparison table's overflow clip → page
  overflow at 360/390 (probe-caught) → .why-network__table positioned.
- Footer wordmark oxblood em = 1.96:1 on dark → inverted on dark chrome.
- 3 GUIDE URLS NOT LOCKED: Sheet 8 names no guide slugs (Sheet 5 backlog
  is topic-less /resources/guides/[topic]). Founder must specify the
  three; learning-center section joins the homepage when they build.
  Recorded in build-new-queue.json _pending_guides.
### Round-4 verification
battery ALL GREEN (incl. new ai-summary-5) · overflow probe 360/390/768:
349/379/753 scrollWidth — clean (drawer open + accordions also clean at
narrow widths; drawer mechanics keyboard-verified: Escape closes, focus
returns) · Lighthouse a11y 100 (zero failing audits) · BP 100 · SEO 100 ·
CLS 0 · perf NOT measurable this round (benchmarkIndex 83–108 under
load; go-remote gate item stands) · 1,796 rendered words · 88 internal
links in main, 79 unique anchor texts, none used >2×, zero bare
anchors · skin guarantee: css-drift check zero hardcoded hex/undeclared
vars in bundle · screenshots in _build/verify/shots/.

## ROUND 3 — HOMEPAGE REFINEMENT (founder audit response)
APPLIED:
- Two-mention disclaimer ceiling: homepage now has EXACTLY two independence/
  trademark mentions — cta-band disclaimer (#home-cta) + AI-summary entry
  (#home-ai-summary, question reworded to "Is TechBrot the same as Intuit or
  QuickBooks?"). Removed: in-brief disclosure block, in-brief source line
  "independent — not Intuit", and the FOOTER trademark sentence (it was a
  third mention). ⚠ Footer removal conflicts with design readme rule 7
  ("disclaimer mandatory … and in the footer") — founder ruling applied;
  reconcile upstream. CEILING IS NOW A STANDING RULE for all non-support
  pages; support silo keeps above-fold disclosure per Sheet 7.
- Hero: H1 unchanged (already the thesis). Subheading replaced with the
  ruled keyword line ("Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisors, accountants, and
  advisors … CFO advisory."). CTAs + intent params unchanged.
- Trust-row tiles per stat ruling: "4× ProAdvisor certifications" ·
  "2 verified Clutch reviews" · "Fixed-fee written-scope pricing" ·
  "Response within one business day" (replaced "U.S.-based" tile; all
  claims baseline-sourced).
AUDIT/PAGE MISMATCH (flagged, rule 7 — sections referenced by the audit
that DO NOT EXIST on the homepage as built; nothing invented):
- "Where accounting is going" section · "What clients say"/"Client work"
  review sections (no verified review TEXT is available in repo sources —
  needs founder-supplied Clutch quotes before any reviews section ships) ·
  stat-tile block ("U.S. incorporated"/"100% vetted") · Learning Center
  guide cards · buyer-routing "Where are you, actually?" · comparison
  table · David Westgate operator block · five-question AI-summary (built
  one has three) · engagement-process section · states grid.
  → The built homepage is the minimal T-HUB per brief §6. If the audit
  reflects a richer target homepage from the design chat, supply that
  section spec and it builds next round.
VERIFIED AFTER EDITS: battery ALL GREEN · overflow clean 360/390/768 ·
Lighthouse a11y 100 / BP 100 / SEO 100 (prod artifact, zero failing audits)
· Intuit-mention containers = exactly {#home-ai-summary, #home-cta}.
PERMISSIONS: .claude/settings.local.json updated per founder instruction.

## MODE: LOCALHOST-ONLY (locked by founder 2026-06-12, until explicitly lifted)
- NO git commits / push / remote setup. NO Cloudflare Pages. NO public preview.
- This file is the commit log until "go remote". First commit then captures
  the whole verified state at once.
- **GO-REMOTE GATE (ALL must pass BEFORE first deploy):**
  1. Fail-closed env safety proven with PREVIEW HEADERS (X-Robots-Tag) on the
     hosting platform — meta-level noindex already proven locally.
  2. `/quickbooks/file-review/` BUILT — homepage CTAs point at it; no CTA may
     404 on a public preview or production (founder ruling 2026-06-12).
  3. Live form test submission (marker TEST-MIGRATION-2026) posted to the
     real Apps Script endpoint and verified in the sheet.
  4. Lighthouse mobile ≥95 re-verified on calibrated infrastructure
     (PageSpeed Insights vs the Cloudflare preview). This machine's
     benchmarkIndex is 192 (~8× below Lighthouse reference) — local mobile
     scores are not calibrated; desktop run on clean build: perf 81 (LCP
     1.16s, host-limited TBT), a11y 100, BP 100, SEO 100, CLS 0.
  5. Production builds from clean output (`npm run build:prod` → _site-prod).
  6. OG-image batch round complete (founder ruling 2026-06-13): auto-generated
     OG cards for all pages via the proven sister-site pattern; the verbatim
     schema/og references (e.g. contact-og.png) resolve to real assets.

## STATUS SNAPSHOT
| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Part A baseline | ✅ FROZEN (139 repo pages) — _build/baseline/ |
| Part B design fetch | ✅ COMPLETE — _design/techbrot-design-system/ · tokens verified · drift documented below |
| Part C factory | ✅ Homepage-scope complete (11ty + bundle + env safety + battery + form/intent JS) |
| Session 2 homepage | ✅ BUILT + VERIFIED on localhost — David photo now live via sharp pipeline (round 7) |
| /quickbooks/file-review/ (T-BOFU #1) | ✅ ROUND 6 BUILT — go-remote gate item 2 CLOSED |
| /contact/ (FIRST ELEVATION, T-BOFU) | ✅ ROUND 7 ELEVATED — pattern APPROVED at audit |
| Sharp pipeline ({% photo %}) | ✅ ROUND 7 BUILT — unblocks editorial breaks, OG images, operator photos |
| Legal silo ×4 + /trust/ + /partners/ (FIRST BATCH) | ✅ ROUND 8 ELEVATED — APPROVED at audit |
| Elevated total | 11 of 139 baseline pages + home + file-review built (round-12 added /pricing/, /about/, /about/methodology/, /about/network/) |
| CSS budget | ✅ ROUND 9 TRIMMED — 56,092 B minified (3,300 B headroom) · 74,975 B source · zero-drift proven |
| Next build | Round 10 changeover ✅ + round 11 polish ✅ (awaiting audit). AFTER audit: the about-silo + /pricing/ elevation batch REVIVES on the new cobalt/warm-paper/Fraunces system — the grind toward the 200-page launch criterion resumes |

## LOCALHOST URLS (for founder check)
- Homepage: http://localhost:8080/ (eleventy --serve, preview build, live-reload)
- **PHONE / LAN (round 11): http://192.168.1.8:8080/** — the eleventy dev
  server binds all interfaces by default; reachable on this Wi-Fi at the
  PC's LAN IP 192.168.1.8 (the 192.168.11.1/198.1 addresses are VMware
  virtual adapters, not the LAN). Preview build = noindex + no analytics +
  live-reload. IP can change on DHCP lease renewal — re-check with
  Get-NetIPAddress (Wi-Fi interface) if the phone can't connect.
- Form harness: http://localhost:8080/dev/form-test/?intent=monthly (try other keys)
- Production artifact: http://localhost:8125/ (serve, _site-prod, what Lighthouse measured)
- Lighthouse reports: _build/verify/lighthouse-home.report.html / lighthouse-desktop.report.html

## PART B — DESIGN INVENTORY (handoff: "TechBrot Design System", fetched 2026-06-12)
- css/: 00-fonts (Google CDN) · 01-tokens (115 tokens, LOCKED) · 02-base
  (LOCKED) · 03-components (101KB, full vocabulary) · 04-pages (141KB,
  page-scoped) · 05-kit (brief-§5 kit) — full set archived in _design/.
- 18 React components in 6 groups · 5 tier templates (t-hub/mofu/bofu/guide/
  location) · ui_kits/website (rendered tier truth) · guidelines specimens ·
  assets: logo-t-black/white.png (200×240 raster — vector still pending),
  motif-ledger-full/single.svg (currentColor, explicit dims).
- TOKEN VERIFICATION: accent #841E1E ✓ · Fraunces/Inter/JetBrains Mono ✓ ·
  fs-12…fs-68 (16 steps) ✓ · space-1…space-40 (15 steps) ✓ · reduced-motion
  zeroing built into tokens ✓.
- DRIFT FOUND (handoff, documented — NOT zero):
  a. 29 hardcoded hex in 03-components.css lines ~4099–4360: the pasted-in
     "contact success panel + intent enrichment" block (off-palette #1A1A1A/
     #DDD9D0/#F0EEE9/#F8EDED/#E4C9C9) + var() fallbacks in the integrations
     dark band. NOT imported into our bundle. Re-tokenize when the contact
     page is rebuilt; upstream fix needed in the design project.
  b. 47 undeclared custom-property usages (--fs-11 ×19, --font-display ×10,
     --fs-19/26, --lh-13/15, --space-9) in the kb-* family + 04-pages.
     Affected sections not imported (except INTAKE FORM → --fs-11 aliased,
     see extensions). Upstream fix needed.

## SESSION-1 EXTENSIONS TO DESIGN CSS (all marked `EXTENSION` in-file; upstream to Claude Design pending)
| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 01-tokens.css | `--fs-11: 0.6875rem` added by name | used-but-undeclared in INTAKE FORM (drift b) — brief rule: never inline |
| 01-tokens.css | `--text-eyebrow` → ink-mute (was ink-faint) | #8B8B85 measured 3.27:1 at 12-13px — WCAG AA fail; brief's "tokens AA-clean" premise was wrong |
| 01-tokens.css | font stacks gained metric-matched fallbacks | CLS 0 during webfont swap |
| 02-base.css | `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` → `auto` | forced slow text path; multi-second Style&Layout on throttled mobile. CONFLICTS WITH "02-base LOCKED" — founder ratification requested |
| 03-components.css (subset) | `.service-card__list a, .service-card__cta { padding-block: var(--space-1) }` | Lighthouse/WCAG 2.2 24px touch-target fail |
| 06-chrome.css | `.site-base a` underline; lockup img explicit 25×30 box | link-distinguishability fail; CLS guard |
| 00-fonts.css | rewritten: self-hosted latin variable woff2 (Fraunces n+i, Inter), metric fallbacks | brief §4 mandate; kills render-blocking CDN CSS. JetBrains Mono NOT self-hosted yet (no usage on built pages) |
- extract_css.py preserves files carrying EXTENSION blocks on re-runs.
- BOM INCIDENT (fixed, battery-visible): PowerShell-written CSS carried UTF-8
  BOMs; concatenation put U+FEFF mid-bundle and esbuild escaped it INTO the
  next selector — `\feff :root` matched nothing and silently killed every
  token. Bundler now strips per-file BOMs. Lesson: all CSS bytes verified in
  the rendered page, not just in the file.

## FACTORY STATE (Part C, homepage scope)
- 11ty 3.1.6 · src/ + _includes/layouts/ (base.njk, t-hub.njk) + _data/
  (site.json single-source NAP/phone/emails/socials/formEndpoint/ga4Id ·
  intents.json · schemaGlobal.json — global @graph extracted VERBATIM from
  baseline: Organization+ProfessionalService, Brand, 2 Person, WebSite).
- CSS: ONE site.min.css bundled in eleventy.before (esbuild), budget-gated.
  Round byte report: source 48,935B / 56,320B budget (7,385B headroom) ·
  minified 30,518B. Curated sections: buttons, hero, tldr, ai-summary,
  service cards, final-cta, intake form (03) · in-brief, framework, cta-band,
  trust-row, disclosure, hero tiers (05) · chrome (06).
- Env fail-closed: preview = noindex,nofollow meta + NO gtag + dev pages
  built; production = index,follow + gtag + dev pages EXCLUDED + clean output
  dir (_site-prod). Proven both ways this round.
- JS: tb-analytics.js (phone_click delegation; events console-only outside
  production) · tb-forms.js (live contact.js port per form-contract.json +
  honeypot company_website [NOT in payload] + intent engine driven by
  intents.json + payload logger outside production).
- intents.json: 90 live keys + lookups + `home` (additive). 11 unmapped live
  keys still to resolve (TODO 5).
- Battery (_build/battery/run_battery.py, ALL GREEN this round): output-URL
  set vs baseline∪queue · anchor/internal-link audit · intent-key existence +
  front-matter duplicate check · founder-name-zero (visible text only) ·
  CSS hex/undeclared-var drift · CSS byte gate.

## HOMEPAGE (T-HUB) — built this round
- Sequence per brief §6: dark hero--hub + inline full-grade ledger motif
  (explicit 560×720, currentColor=accent) → in-brief + independence
  disclosure → TL;DR #home-tldr (speakable-paired) → silo card-grid
  #home-services (routing root: accounting, quickbooks, advisory, vs,
  find-an-accountant, pricing + trust/methodology/partners via list links)
  → ai-summary #home-ai-summary (3 Q&A incl. not-Intuit disambiguation)
  → framework ("Two delivery modes. One operating standard." — REAL coined
  concept from /about/ + /about/methodology/ baseline copy) → trust-row
  (Certified ProAdvisor ×4 products · "2 verified Clutch reviews" stated
  honestly · fixed-fee · U.S.-based) → cta-band + mandatory trademark
  disclaimer. No FAQ (not in T-HUB sequence; none fabricated).
- Funnel wiring: hero primary → /contact/?intent=home · hero ghost →
  /quickbooks/file-review/?intent=home (slug CONFIRMED by founder, queued
  next) · cta-band → /contact/?intent=home. Informational links carry no
  intent (nav links ≠ conversion CTAs — interpretation noted for audit).
- Schema: global @graph verbatim + per-page WebPage (speakable #home-tldr-body)
  + BreadcrumbList + ItemList(6 silos), all via dump|safe.
- Section IDs follow #home-* convention (anchors-are-equity rule).

## VERIFICATION RESULTS (this round, localhost)
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Battery (6 checks) | ✅ ALL GREEN |
| Lighthouse desktop (clean prod artifact) | perf 81 · a11y 100 · BP 100 · SEO 100 |
| CLS / LCP / FCP (desktop) | 0 / 1162ms / 756ms |

## FOUNDER RULINGS LOG
1. 2026-06-12 — No live-site fetches; sources = repo + Claude Design only.
   Archived form/intent JS + form-contract.json KEPT as the payload ruling.
2. 24 live-but-not-in-repo URLs → BUILD-NEW queue, URLs locked.
3. baseline.json frozen (139 pages) as content-equity contract.
4. Build order: HOMEPAGE first, then silo-by-silo elevation.
5. LOCALHOST-ONLY mode; commit/push/Cloudflare deferred to "go remote".
6. GA4 events implemented but disabled outside production.
7. No live form POST until go-remote; payload logged instead.
8. /quickbooks/file-review/ CONFIRMED (Sheet 8); queued; go-remote blocker.
9. 2026-06-12 (round 6) — file-review intent registry: `file-review`
   added; canonical key for every problem/symptom/error CTA.
10. 2026-06-12 (round 6) — tb-forms.js intent engine: empty URL params
    no longer wipe HTML defaults; collect() loop still writes
    data-meta fields "ALWAYS" so the live form contract is preserved.
11. 2026-06-13 (round 7) — DAVID PHOTO: build the sharp pipeline NOW
    (factory infrastructure), wire the photo through it. No interim
    raw <img>.
12. 2026-06-13 (round 7) — CSS GATE: minified hard gate raised 55→58 KB
    (59,392 B). Conditions: source trim pass scheduled during silo
    elevation (target <75 KB source); 58 KB is the CEILING THROUGH
    CUTOVER — the gate does not move again.
13. 2026-06-13 (round 7) — BUILD ORDER: pattern-locking first — /contact/
    elevation (first elevation of an existing page) BEFORE cleanup tiers
    and the T-GUIDE trio. One page, then stop for audit.
14. 2026-06-13 (round-7 audit) — ELEVATION PATTERN APPROVED. The 4
    /contact/ removals SIGNED OFF. Chrome-relocated differ class created
    (footer/nav headings ≠ removals). Calendly FAQ #7 placement KEEP —
    real founder link, correct urgent-intent placement; flag closed.
15. 2026-06-13 — OG images: one auto-generated batch round before
    go-remote (gate item 6); not per-page work.
16. 2026-06-13 — BATCH ORDER: first elevation batch = legal silo +
    standalone trust pages (6 pages: legal×4, /trust/, /partners/),
    chrome:full, tier tints per table; legal pages skip the Q/A
    architecture; trust + partners get the full standing pattern.
17. 2026-06-13 (round-8 audit) — ROUND 8 APPROVED. Trust quick-5
    rewordings APPROVED · partners FAQPage retirements SIGNED OFF
    (schema that never matched rendered = live defect, not equity) ·
    partners retargets APPROVED with upgrade: NEW `partner-apply`
    intent key — "Start the Application" → ?intent=partner-apply,
    "Ask a Question First" → ?intent=partner-question; anchor
    retargets as-is · TODO 18 stands open (founder photography).
18. 2026-06-13 — TWO-MENTION CEILING EXEMPTION CLASS: TOPICAL PAGES.
    Pages whose baseline topic IS independence/trademark (e.g. /trust/)
    are exempt from the two-mention ceiling, alongside the Sheet-7
    support-silo exception. Ceiling still binds everywhere else.
19. 2026-06-13 — NEXT ROUND = CSS DEEP TRIM ONLY (TODO 17): source
    <75 KB, minified headroom ≥2 KB under the 59,392 B gate; computed
    styles must remain IDENTICAL on all 10 built pages (battery +
    overflow + spot Lighthouse home/file-review/trust = pass condition).
20. 2026-06-13 — STOP AFTER TRIM REPORT. No further page batches: a
    DESIGN SYSTEM CHANGEOVER is next (new brand, spec to follow);
    remaining elevation resumes on the new system. The about-silo +
    /pricing/ batch is CANCELLED pending the changeover.
21. 2026-06-13 (round 11) — HEADER ALIGN: founder ACCEPTED the edge_probe
    measurement disproving the round-10 visual impression. Header is NOT
    misaligned (pixel-identical to body/hero at all widths); the narrow
    reading-column inset >900px is INTENTIONAL — leave it. Task (a)
    closed "verified already aligned, no change."
22. 2026-06-13 (round 11) — FAQ FLAT is a STANDING RULE sitewide: every
    FAQ is the /contact/ shape (flat Q → prose answer, no bullet lists in
    answers, no nested child Q/As). Enforced by battery check `faq-flat`.
    Nested FAQ markup is retired. Where a baseline FAQ was nested
    (/partners/), every parent AND child survives as its own flat pair.
23. 2026-06-13 (round-11 audit) — ROUND 11 APPROVED. Within-page variety
    extended: #partners-principles (parallel list, not a sequence) →
    `grid-3` cards, removing the last numbered-grid repeat. STANDING
    COMPOSITION RULE reaffirmed: a numbered `.process-diagram` appears at
    most once per page; parallel lists take card grids, sequences take
    `.flow`/timeline. New session/model (Opus 4.8 1M) validated; the
    about-silo + /pricing/ elevation batch is next.

## STANDING RULES (locked)
- ROUND REPORTS ON DISK (founder rule 2026-06-13, EXTENDED same day):
  at the end of every round, the full round report is written to
  _build/reports/round-N.md in addition to the terminal output. The file
  must be COMPLETE STANDALONE — it ends with an "OPEN ITEMS / STOPPED AT"
  section carrying every question, flag, and pending ruling exactly as
  stated in the terminal sign-off. The founder audits from the file
  alone. (equity_report.py <url> generates the per-item differ for
  every elevation report.)
- CHROME-RELOCATED differ class (founder ruling 2026-06-13): baseline
  headings that exist only as site chrome (footer columns, nav) are
  classified CHROME-RELOCATED (present in the full-chrome variant), not
  removals — no per-page sign-off. True removals (e.g. the newsletter
  band) stay JUSTIFIED-REMOVED; the newsletter-band class itself is
  SIGNED OFF (2026-06-13).
- NO CHAINED/COMPLEX SHELL ONE-LINERS (founder rule 2026-06-12): every
  multi-step operation lives as a named script in _build/scripts/ —
  dev-server.ps1 · build-prod.ps1 · battery.ps1 · lighthouse.ps1 [desktop]
  · lighthouse-page.ps1 [-Path -Slug -Preset] · overflow_probe.ps1 [path]
  · screenshots.ps1 / screenshots-file-review.ps1 / screenshots-contact.ps1
  · shot_anchor.ps1 [-Path -Anchor -Out -Port -Root] (round-11: -Port/-Root
    added — shoot the preview _site/8090, not just _site-prod/8125)
  · edge_probe.ps1 [-Path -Width] (round-11: header/body left-edge +
    padding diagnostic) · kill_probe.ps1 (round-11: clear stray probe/
    screenshot chrome between runs — headless=new leaks on this machine)
  · form_probe.ps1 (file-review)
  · form_probe_contact.ps1 · scout_intents.py · equity_report.py [url]
  (+ lh_summary.py). Reuse every round; add new scripts there.
  Encoding gotcha (2026-06-13): em-dashes in .ps1 written as UTF-8
  no-BOM parse as CP-1252 smart quotes in PowerShell 5.1 and break
  string terminators — ASCII punctuation only in scripts.
- ONE CLASS SYSTEM SITE-WIDE — pages compose Design-system classes only; new
  patterns enter the component layer as named token-driven classes, reported
  with byte cost. (This round's additions: only the EXTENSION fixes above.)
- SECTION IDs are equity — existing IDs survive elevation; new pages use
  #<slug>-tldr / #<slug>-faq convention. Battery anchor audit every round.

## TODO LEDGER
| # | Item | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | NAV/FOOTER: no canonical design — minimal chrome shipping; do not invent | Until design ruling |
| 2 | ✅ SUPERSEDED round 10 (founder ruling) — the new brand chain ships vector logos (logo-horizontal[-dark].svg, monogram[-dark].svg, favicon.svg) + full favicon/PWA PNG set. The old PNG-mark need is moot | SUPERSEDED |
| 3 | /about/network/ missing canonical (live defect) — fix at elevation | Elevation |
| 4 | Strip `<title>BSS-1-11ty</title>` artifact (139/139) at port | Elevation |
| 5 | ✅ CLOSED round 7 — all 11 keys added to intents.json (additive, canonical pricing); scout_intents.py reports 106/106 live keys mapped | DONE |
| 6 | Upstream the Session-1 EXTENSION fixes + drift list to the Claude Design project | Founder relay |
| 7 | 02-base `text-rendering` edit conflicts with "locked" — ratify or revert | Founder ruling |
| 8 | ✅ CLOSED round 10 (founder confirmed) — changeover replaced JetBrains Mono with self-hosted IBM Plex Mono 400/500/600 (latin woff2); mono need fully met | DONE |
| 9 | og:image / twitter:image — RULED 2026-06-13: single batch round of auto-generated OG cards for ALL pages (proven sister-site pattern) before go-remote. Added as GO-REMOTE GATE ITEM 6. Not per-page work | OG batch round |
| 10 | CSS budget tension at scale: full design CSS is ~275KB vs 55KB budget — per-round curation holds for now; founder ruling needed before the budget blocks elevation | Watch |
| 11 | Research-layer logging start (Sheet 5: "cannot backfill") | Founder decision |
| 12 | Funnel-logic-per-tier table (symptom/error→file-review · vs→/switch/ [PLANNED v2 — confirm before wiring] · guides→soft CTA · hubs→primary service CTA) — fill as tiers build | Part C cont. |
| 13 | `--color-accent-soft #B85050` flagged "avoid/possibly vestigial" by brief §4 — confirm removal upstream | Founder relay |
| 14 | ✅ CLOSED round 7 — sharp pipeline built ({% photo %}, @11ty/eleventy-img), David photo wired through it on the homepage team card; CLS 0 verified | DONE |
| 15 | ✅ CLOSED round 7 — gate re-ratified 58 KB (59,392 B), CEILING THROUGH CUTOVER; source trim pass scheduled during silo elevation (target <75 KB source) | DONE |
| 16 | LIVE DEFECT /legal/privacy/ dead link — SWEEP COMPLETE round 8: only carriers were /contact/ (fixed r7) + /quickbooks/speak-to-a-quickbooks-expert/ (fix at its elevation). Plus NEW dead-link class found on /partners/ (apply/benefits/requirements — retargeted r8, sign-off pending) | speak-to-expert elevation |
| 17 | ✅ CLOSED round 9 — deep trim done: minified 56,092 B (3,300 B headroom), source 74,975 B (<75 KB ✓). Zero-drift proven (20/20 computed-style fingerprints identical). Remaining headroom if ever needed: ~870 B unused rules + 6.1 KB comments in LOCKED 01-tokens/02-base (needs TODO 7-class ratification) | DONE |
| 18 | /trust/ editorial-break imagery: live referenced /assets/img/services/trust-editorial-*.webp — not in repo. Decorative section omitted at elevation; needs founder-supplied real imagery through the sharp pipeline | Founder asset |
| 19 | Two-mention ceiling vs /trust/ baseline content (~6 independence mentions — the page's topic): equity carried, ceiling exemption requested | Founder ruling |
