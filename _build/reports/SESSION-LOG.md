# TechBrot — Rolling Session Log
_Standing rule (founder 2026-06-20): append a complete, stand-alone summary of EVERY turn here —
newest at the BOTTOM, with a turn header + timestamp. This is the single file the founder uploads to
the strategy chat, so each entry must be self-contained (what was done · decisions · flags · COUNT line).
Milestone `round-NN.md` reports continue in addition._

---

## Prior context (pre-log, condensed — full detail in round reports + BUILD-TRACKER resume anchor)
- **Phase:** GROWTH complete (586 live pages, noindex preview, never flipped) → **DESIGN RE-ARCHITECTURE** (pre-flip).
- **Design prep done:** SECTION-SIGNATURE-MAP (25 families) · 25 kitchen-sink reference pages under `/dev/` ·
  DESIGN-CONTRACT (FREE/FROZEN) · handed off to Claude Design project "TechBrot Design System Elevation".
- **v5 sync:** `techbrot-blueprint-v5.xlsx` = strategic truth; ARCHITECTURE-TRUTH + BUILD-TRACKER reconciled to it.
- **Turn 1 (design impl, read+plan):** connected to the design project; 23/23 templates readable (25 families);
  produced + got approval for the implementation plan (Phase 0 foundation → G1+D1 proof → family-by-family).

---

## Turn — 2026-06-20 · Pre-implementation repo cleanup (isolated commit)
**Goal:** clean the working tree before any src/ implementation — archive stale, hard-delete dead, keep active.
Founder-approved buckets + 3 flag answers + new standing rules (rolling session log; build-plan GO).

**Did:**
- Verified Flag 2: root `assets/` holds only `assets/people/david-westgate.jpg`, referenced live by
  `src/index.njk` `{% photo %}` (eleventy-img source) → **KEPT** (not archived).
- Ran `_build/scripts/cleanup_archive.sh` (scripted per no-inline-multistep rule; reversible):
  - **ARCHIVED → `/_archive/`** (git-tracked): ~73 historical `round-*.md` (kept `round-01-design-impl.md`);
    superseded `_build/reports` docs (FINAL-MIGRATION-REPORT, MIGRATION-PROTOCOL, RESKIN-HANDOFF, cloudflare-fix,
    **PAGE-TYPE-REGISTRY** [Flag 1]); root design docs (REDESIGN-BRIEF, PREMIUM-UPGRADE-PLAN); old design system
    (`_design/`, `_build/design-capture/`, `_build/archive/old-skin`); ~28 dead one-off scripts + `design_audit.py` [Flag 3].
  - **HARD-DELETED** (🔴 regenerable/dead): untracked `_build/reports/_*.txt` scratch · `_build/design-handoff/`
    (delivered, regenerable) · tracked design-transfer bins (`design-handoff-v2.bin`, `design-payload.bin`,
    `design-headers.txt`) · `_build/verify/` (gitignored artifacts) · `_build/tmp/` · `_build/serve.log`.
  - **KEPT** [Flag 3]: `extract_css.py`, `fetch_fonts*` (Phase-0 useful).
- Guardrail held: **nothing in `src/`, `baseline.json`, battery, capture data, or any old-live freeze-source
  removed/archived** — stays until after flip + redirect map.
- Started this rolling SESSION-LOG.md (standing rule).

**Decisions / flags:** Flag1 PAGE-TYPE-REGISTRY → ARCHIVE (Template Registry + SECTION-SIGNATURE-MAP own structure now).
Flag2 root assets/ → KEEP (live photo source). Flag3 → keep extract_css/fetch_fonts, archive design_audit.
Build plan APPROVED (form-handler scaffold yes; B4/B5 map-by-file; Phase-0 whole-look-on-noindex OK; commit-per-batch +
spot-check first page of each template). Next: Phase 0 (capture shared system) → G1+D1 proof → **PAUSE for founder spot-check**.

**COUNT:** cleanup commit (isolated) · src/ files changed = 0 · archived buckets = 6 · hard-deleted = 🔴 bucket only ·
working tree after = live `src/` + active `_build/` (baseline/battery/data/scripts/reports-current) + governing docs +
`/_archive/` + generated `_site*`. Next turn = Phase 0 foundation.

## Turn — 2026-06-20 · Phase 0 foundation, Step 1–2 (fonts + tokens) · commit `c7fe356`
**Goal:** begin capturing the locked design's shared foundation (everything inherits it). This turn = the
irreducible base (fonts + tokens). Holds the fidelity bar (clean token rebuild, pixel-faithful to the
*rendered* design; freeze never bent — flag collisions) the founder set mid-build.

**Key finding:** `src/assets/css` was NOT old Bootstrap — it was a *prior, superseded* elevation (cold
"Ledger Ink #1E3A70" + Geist Mono, 2026-06-16). The locked system is **warm Petrol #0E4A50 + Spline Sans Mono**.
Phase 0 re-cuts this existing tokenized layer system to the new values (token names preserved → component
layers inherit; css-drift stays green).

**Did:**
- **Fonts (`00-fonts.css`):** self-hosted **Spline Sans Mono** (var 400–600, fetched from fontsource/jsDelivr →
  `spline-sans-mono-var-latin.woff2`); retired Geist Mono / Public Sans / IBM Plex Mono (5 woff2 `git rm`).
  Fraunces + Geist kept. Metric fallbacks updated.
- **Tokens (`01-tokens.css`):** re-cut every value to WARM/PETROL. **Split the two accent ROLES** (the old
  system had one): Petrol `#0E4A50` (brand/links/marks) vs **NEW `--cta` Burnt Clay `#BE5240`** (CTA fills only,
  never links) vs tie-out green `#157A52` (verification only). Warm surfaces, 74px header, two-step section
  rhythm (64 content / 96 flagship / 72 mobile), diagram/illus/surface/measure/icon groups all warm.
- Verified: clean build GREEN (exit 0); bundle carries petrol values, **zero stale cold hex** (`#1E3A70`/
  `Geist Mono`/`#FBFCFE` = 0); CSS 80,633B / gate 83,968B.

**Decisions / flags:**
- ⚠ **Font discrepancy flagged + resolved:** Handoff token table says `--font-mono = Geist Mono`, but
  HANDOFF-MANIFEST (governs) + all locked templates specify **Spline Sans Mono** → used Spline Sans Mono.
- Old `figure-*.svg` diagram partials + dev kitchen-sink pages still carry `Geist Mono`/cold hex → **rebuilt in
  Phase-0 Step 4 (diagrams)**; until then a few diagram numbers fall back to system mono (WIP, not shipped-blocking).

**Phase 0 remaining (next turns, before the proof):** Step 3 chrome (mega-nav + light footer + call-bar +
`tb-nav.js`) · component CTA-repoint to `--cta` + section layouts (02–09) to the locked look · Step 4 diagrams
(4 signature) + 24 icons · Step 5 import real Intuit badges · Step 6 reset gates. **THEN** G1 + D1 proof →
⛔ PAUSE for founder spot-check (no fan-out).

**COUNT:** Phase-0 progress = Step 1–2 of 6 done · commit `c7fe356` · src files changed = 8 (2 css recut, 1 font
add, 5 font rm) · build GREEN 611 pages · CSS 80,633B/83,968B · NOT a foundation-complete; continuing next turn.

## Turn — 2026-06-20 · Phase 0 foundation, Step 3 (chrome) · commit `96351d6`
**Goal:** re-skin the sitewide chrome (mega-nav · footer · call-bar · nav JS) to the locked Gallery-04 look.
Holds the fidelity bar (clean token rebuild; pixel-faithful to the *rendered* design; freeze untouched).

**Finding:** the existing chrome was already a full mid-mega + light-footer system, fully tokenized — so the
prior token re-cut already moved its palette to warm/petrol. Remaining work = the **structural design deltas**
only. `tb-nav.js` already implements the exact behavior contract (one-open · Esc · outside-close · focus-return ·
scroll-lock · drawer accordion) → KEPT as-is.

**Did:**
- **Two accent ROLES enforced** (the crux): `btn--primary` → **Burnt Clay `--cta`** (the one loud conversion fill —
  final-CTA / call-block / call-bar / drawer call); added **`btn--dark`** (restrained dark ink) for the **header CTA**
  (the design's header button is dark, not loud clay).
- **util-bar:** light → **dark strip** (green dot + "Independent ProAdvisor firm · U.S.-based" left; "Find an Accountant"
  + "For Accountants →" links right).
- **header backdrop** → warm `rgba(252,251,248,.9)` (was a hardcoded cold rgba the token swap couldn't reach).
- **nav uniform pills** (design premium sweep): one weight/color, sand-pill hover the only differentiator; removed the
  old per-link underline-rule.
- **mega panels:** **hub link where the phone was** (founder's pattern) → `/accounting/` · `/quickbooks/`; megalink
  left-border + translateX hover.
- **footer** surface → sand `--surface-subtle` (light editorial `<details>`, already structurally correct).
- Verified: build GREEN (exit 0); bundle carries `btn--primary{--cta}`, `btn--dark`, dark util links, hub-link footers;
  CSS 81,394B / gate 83,968B.

**Decisions / flags:**
- **For-Accountants link:** the design util points to `/for-accountants/` (doesn't exist) → routed to the real **`/partners/`**
  (the firm's accountant-partner program). Flag for founder confirm.
- **Real URLs kept** over the design's env shorthands (`/file-review/`, `/quickbooks/expert/`, `/accounting/sales-tax/`)
  — those would 404; used the real slugs (`/quickbooks/file-review/`, `…/speak-to-a-quickbooks-expert/`, `…/sales-tax-compliance/`).
- **Deferred chrome polish** (not blocking; next pass): SVG caret in triggers (currently a CSS-border caret that rotates) ·
  `.prose a` animated slide-underline craft detail (currently a static petrol underline) · header height 64 vs manifest's 74 (used the
  rendered Gallery's 64-ish via existing token). Will reconcile during the G1/D1 proof.

**Phase 0 remaining:** Step 4 diagrams (4 signature) + 24 icons · Step 5 real Intuit badges · Step 6 reset gates →
THEN G1 + D1 proof → ⛔ PAUSE for founder spot-check.

**COUNT:** Phase-0 = Step 1–3 of 6 done · commits `c7fe356` (fonts/tokens) + `96351d6` (chrome) · src files changed this
turn = 3 (03-conversion, 04-chrome, site-header) · build GREEN 611 pages · CSS 81,394B/83,968B · still not at the G1+D1 pause.

**Founder flag answers (chrome):** (1) `/partners/` for "For Accountants" — CONFIRMED keep. (2) Real-URLs-over-design-shorthands
— CONFIRMED standing practice (always use the real frozen slug, never the design's 404-ing placeholder). (3) Header 64-vs-74 —
defer to proof BUT do a side-by-side height comparison vs the design template at G1/D1 and match the *rendered* design; show founder.

## Turn — 2026-06-20 · Phase 0 foundation, Step 4 (diagrams + icons) · commit `65c1585`
**Did:**
- **4 signature diagram partials re-cut** (`figure-taccount` · `figure-reconcile-flow` · `figure-cleanup-beforeafter` ·
  `figure-judgment`): every hardcoded diagram color → `var(--diagram-*)` role token (petrol credit / green tie / warm
  rule+grid+node), `Geist Mono` → `Spline Sans Mono`, swap-friendly `data-viz` + `data-viz-state="FINAL"` on each root
  `<svg>` (inline partials → `var()` resolves in the live DOM). Clears the cold-hex/Geist-Mono debt from the tokens turn.
- **Icons:** the existing 8 (`phone·check·chevron-down·arrow-right·menu·minus·star·x`) are already the design style —
  Lucide-grade **stroke 1.75 + currentColor** — so they auto-inherit the palette. The full 24-icon set is added
  per-component as needed (lean; not pre-building unused icons).
- Verified: build GREEN; home renders `data-viz="taccount-tieout"` + `var(--diagram-credit)`; D1 renders its figure;
  zero `Geist Mono`/cold hex in built figures. Script `_build/scripts/recut_diagrams.py`.

**Flags / notes:** full 24-icon set deferred to per-component (flag if you want all 24 pre-built) · the D1 2nd viz
`cleanup-timeline` (FINAL in the design) is built when D1 is built (the proof) · "numbers mirrored in real text" honesty
gate is per-page (each page's caption/table mirrors its figure numbers) — enforced at family build.

**Phase 0 remaining:** Step 5 import real Intuit badges · Step 6 reset gates → THEN G1 + D1 proof → ⛔ PAUSE for spot-check.

**COUNT:** Phase-0 = Step 1–4 of 6 done · commits `c7fe356`+`96351d6`+`65c1585` · src changed this turn = 4 figure SVGs ·
build GREEN 611 pages · CSS unchanged (SVG only) · still not at the G1+D1 pause; badges + gates next, then proof.
