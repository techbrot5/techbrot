        <section class="policy-body container"><div class="policy-content">
    <h4>1. General Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy</h4>
    <p>
        At <strong>techbrot.com</strong>, customer satisfaction is important. This Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy explains how refunds, cancellations, payment reversals and chargebacks are handled, and is subject to the TechBrot, Inc. Bookkeeping &amp; Accounting Services Agreement (the “Service Agreement”) and our <a href="/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>. In case of any conflict, the signed Service Agreement and Order Form control.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Non-Refundable Services</h4>
    <p>The following services are non-refundable once delivered or fully performed:</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
        <li><strong>Initial Setup &amp; Onboarding</strong> – one-time setup services (including QuickBooks setup, chart of accounts configuration, and initial system access or configuration) are non-refundable once performed due to the immediate consumption of professional time and resources.</li>
        <li><strong>One-time Advisory or Training Sessions</strong> – fees for on-demand training, advisory sessions or deliverables are non-refundable after the session is completed or the deliverable has been delivered and accepted (see Section 4 review period).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Refunds for Subscription-Based Services</h4>
    <p>Subscription services (monthly or quarterly bookkeeping retainers, software-as-a-service that we manage, or recurring advisory packages) are handled as follows:</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
        <li><strong>Trial / Early Cancellation:</strong> If your subscription includes a trial period or a written cancellation window specified in the Order Form, you may be eligible for a full refund if you cancel within that trial/window and the service has not been materially used.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Subscription Refunds:</strong> If no trial is specified, subscription charges are generally non-refundable for the billing period after services have been rendered. If subscription services have not been materially used, TechBrot may, at its discretion, issue a prorated refund if requested within <strong>30 days</strong> of the charge—subject to the terms of the Order Form.</li>
        <li><strong>Prorated Credits:</strong> Where applicable and at TechBrot’s discretion, prorated credits (not cash refunds) may be offered for partially used subscription periods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Refunds for Deliverables & One-Time Services</h4>
    <p>For Deliverables produced under the Service Agreement (reports, reconciliations, cleanup work, catch-up bookkeeping, etc.):</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
        <li><strong>7-Day Review Period:</strong> Clients have <strong>seven (7) calendar days</strong> from delivery of a Deliverable to request revisions or dispute the Deliverable in writing to <a href="mailto:support@techbrot.com">support@techbrot.com</a>. You must include supporting details and any relevant documents. If no dispute is raised within seven (7) calendar days, the Deliverable will be deemed accepted and fees become non-refundable except at TechBrot’s discretion.</li>
        <li><strong>Rework:</strong> If a valid issue is identified within the review period, TechBrot will, where appropriate, rework the Deliverable at no additional charge or issue a partial refund as agreed in writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Consulting & Sessions:</strong> One-time consulting sessions are non-refundable once completed; cancellations made prior to the scheduled session may be eligible for partial refund or credit per the Order Form or scheduling policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. How to Request a Refund or Revision</h4>
    <p>To request a refund, revision, or to dispute a charge:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Email <a href="mailto:support@techbrot.com">support@techbrot.com</a> with: (a) your invoice or order number; (b) the Deliverable or service name; (c) a clear description of the issue; and (d) supporting documentation (screenshots, files, emails).</li>
        <li>TechBrot will acknowledge receipt within two (2) business days and investigate.</li>
        <li>If TechBrot determines a refund or rework is appropriate, we will notify you of the resolution and the refund processing timeline.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>6. Refund Processing Time</h4>
    <p>
        Approved refunds are processed within <strong>7–14 business days</strong> and will be returned to the original payment method where feasible. Actual timing depends on banks and payment processors. Third-party fees (payment processor or bank charges) that are non-refundable by the processor may be deducted unless otherwise agreed.
    </p>

    <h4>7. Chargebacks, Payment Reversals & Dispute Policy</h4>
    <p>
        We strongly encourage you to contact our support team before initiating any chargeback or dispute with your bank or card issuer. Unauthorized chargebacks may cause service suspension and may result in denial of future services.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a chargeback, reversal or payment dispute is initiated, TechBrot may suspend Services while investigating. If the dispute is ultimately resolved in TechBrot’s favor, Client will be responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul class="check-list">
        <li>The original disputed amount;</li>
        <li>All bank, payment processor and administrative fees;</li>
        <li>Reasonable collection costs and attorneys’ fees incurred to recover the amount; and</li>
        <li>Any other damages or direct costs arising from the chargeback (including re-onboarding fees or temporary suspension costs).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Fraudulent or Abusive Chargebacks:</strong> TechBrot reserves the right to pursue all available remedies to recover amounts related to fraudulent or unauthorized chargebacks, including contacting payment processors, reporting abusive behavior to relevant authorities, and pursuing civil or criminal legal action where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h4>8. Returned ACH Items & Fees</h4>
    <p>
        Returned ACH debits, failed payments or rejected transfers may incur a returned-item fee as set in the Order Form (commonly $25 or the amount stated). TechBrot may reattempt collection, suspend Services until payment is resolved, and invoice Client for any bank charges and administrative costs arising from the returned item.
    </p>

    <h4>9. Exceptions & Special Cases</h4>
    <p>
        Exceptional refund requests (duplicate charges, accidental purchases, billing errors) will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Resolution may depend on timing, supporting documentation, third-party processor rules, and the specifics of the Order Form.
    </p>

    <h4>10. ACH Authorization & Record Retention</h4>
    <p>
        For Clients who authorize ACH debits, TechBrot will retain signed ACH mandates and payment authorizations for a minimum of <strong>two (2) years</strong> from the date of signature (or longer if required by applicable banking rules or legal obligations) to support audit and dispute resolution procedures.
    </p>

    <h4>11. Suspension of Services, Collections & Past-Due Balances</h4>
    <p>
        TechBrot reserves the right to suspend Services for unpaid invoices, unresolved chargebacks, or returned payments until the matter is resolved. Overdue balances may be referred to collections and Client will be responsible for collection costs, interest, and reasonable attorneys’ fees as permitted by law and the Order Form.
    </p>

    <h4>12. Third-Party Processors & Non-Liability</h4>
    <p>
        TechBrot uses third-party payment processors for card and ACH transactions. TechBrot is not responsible for the policies, practices, or downtime of such processors. Processing delays caused by third-party providers do not relieve Client of payment obligations.
    </p>

    <h4>13. Disclosure & Cooperation for Disputes</h4>
    <p>
        In the event of a dispute, TechBrot may rely on or supply evidence including signed ACH mandates, Order Forms, scope documents, change orders, timestamps, email correspondence, invoices and Deliverables. Clients must cooperate and provide requested documentation in a timely manner to assist resolution.
    </p>
