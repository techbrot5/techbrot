    <h4>1. Introduction / Scope</h4>
    <p>TechBrot Inc. ("TechBrot," "we," "us," or "our") is a Delaware-incorporated company operating https://techbrot.com (the "Site") and providing bookkeeping, QuickBooks setup, MSP and consulting services (the "Services"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information when you visit our Site or use our Services. It also explains rights available to residents of specific jurisdictions (California, EU/EEA) and how to exercise them. By using the Site or Services you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h4>2. Business Disclaimer / Third-Party References</h4>
    <p>We may reference or link to third-party products and services (for example: QuickBooks, Intuit, Twilio, Google Analytics, payment processors). These references are for identification and informational purposes only. TechBrot Inc. is <strong>not</strong> affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Intuit QuickBooks, Intuit, or other third parties unless explicitly stated. If you submit information directly to a third-party site (for example, filling a form hosted by QuickBooks or a payment gateway), that submission is governed by that third party’s privacy policy. If we share data with any third party as a processor, we will use a written Data Processing Agreement (DPA) where required by law.</p>

    <h4>3. Information We Collect</h4>
    <p>We collect personal and non-personal information that you provide and that we automatically collect when you interact with our Site or Services. Examples include:</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
        <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: name, email address, phone number, billing/shipping address, company name, job title, payment details (tokenized by payment processor), IP address, device identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensitive categories</strong>: We do not intentionally collect special-category data (e.g., health, racial information) except if you voluntarily submit it for a support reason. If we ever need such data, we will obtain explicit consent as required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatically collected / technical data</strong>: cookies, usage logs, browser and device information, referring URLs, and analytics data.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party sources</strong>: We may receive data from third-party providers (for example, analytics providers, lead providers). We document categories and sources in our data inventory and update our notices accordingly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Categories of Personal Information Collected (CCPA framing)</h4>
    <p>In the last 12 months we may have collected categories including, but not limited to:</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
        <li>Identifiers (name, email, phone, postal address).</li>
        <li>Payment information and transactional data (payment provider tokens, invoice history).</li>
        <li>Internet/network activity (IP address, pages visited, cookies).</li>
        <li>Professional information (company name, job title).</li>
        <li>Inferences and profiling for marketing and service personalization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. How We Use Personal Information (Purposes)</h4>
    <p>We use personal information to:</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
        <li>Provide, operate, and improve the Services and to fulfill contractual obligations (onboarding, billing, support).</li>
        <li>Process payments and send invoices.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about service-related matters, news, or updates (with consent where required).</li>
        <li>Improve the Site, run analytics and advertising, and prevent fraud or abuse.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations (tax, lawful requests from authorities).</li>
        <li>Enforce our Terms of Service, and protect the rights, property, or safety of TechBrot and others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6. Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)</h4>
    <p>For EU/EEA data subjects, our legal bases include:</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
        <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> where processing is necessary to deliver Services or process payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> to comply with legal obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> for fraud prevention, product improvement, and internal business operations (we balance interests against individual rights).</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where we rely on consent (e.g., marketing cookies). You may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. Data Sharing and Third-Party Processors</h4>
    <p>We do not sell personal data for monetary gain. We share data with service providers who perform services on our behalf (processors), including but not limited to: payment processors, cloud hosting, analytics, email/marketing platforms, telephony providers (e.g., Twilio), and professional advisors. Where required, we maintain contracts (DPAs) that require processors to protect personal data and only use it per our instructions. If we are required to disclose information by law, we will do so only as required.</p>

    <h4>8. Cookies, Tracking &amp; Advertising</h4>
    <p>We use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to operate the Site and for analytics and advertising purposes. You can manage cookie preferences via the cookie consent banner or your browser settings; however, disabling cookies may limit functionality. For data subject consent management and platform requirements we follow applicable guidelines.</p>

    <h4>9. International Transfers &amp; Storage</h4>
    <p>If you are located outside the United States, your personal data may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the U.S. or other countries. We implement appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses, where applicable) to protect international transfers and will comply with applicable transfer rules.</p>

    <h4>10. Data Retention</h4>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide Services, comply with obligations (tax/accounting), resolve disputes, and meet legal requirements. Retention periods differ by data type—for example: transactional records for billing are retained for the period required by tax laws (typically 7 years for U.S. tax recordkeeping), while marketing consent metadata is retained until consent is withdrawn. When data is no longer needed we securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

    <h4>11. Security Practices</h4>
    <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (access controls, encryption of backups, secure providers) to protect data. While we use industry-standard measures, no system is completely secure; in the event of a security incident we will respond in accordance with applicable law, notify affected individuals where required, and cooperate with regulators.</p>

    <h4>12. Children’s Privacy</h4>
    <p>Our Site and Services are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover we have collected such data without parental consent, we will promptly delete it.</p>

    <h4>13. Links &amp; Third-Party Sites</h4>
    <p>Our Site may contain links to third-party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third parties; please review their privacy notices before sharing data with them. We are not responsible for their practices or content.</p>

    <h4>14. California Residents — CCPA / CPRA Notice &amp; Rights (short form)</h4>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you have the following rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), where applicable:</p>
    <ul class="check-list">
        <li><strong>Right to know:</strong> request categories of personal information we have collected, disclosed, or sold in the last 12 months and the purposes for which we used it.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to delete:</strong> request deletion of personal information we collected from you (with exceptions).</li>
        <li><strong>Right to opt-out:</strong> opt out of sale or sharing of personal information. If we ever sell or share data we will provide a clear "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to non-discrimination:</strong> for exercising privacy rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to correct &amp; limit:</strong> request correction and to limit use of sensitive personal information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>How to submit a request:</strong> Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@techbrot.com">privacy@techbrot.com</a> or Phone: (850) 842-6767. We will verify requests as required by law and respond within the statutory timeframe.</p>

    <h4>15. EU / EEA Residents — GDPR Rights &amp; Contact</h4>
    <p>If you are in the EU/EEA you have the following rights under the GDPR (subject to legal conditions): access, rectification, deletion (right to be forgotten), restriction of processing, data portability, and objection. You also have the right to withdraw consent where consent is the lawful basis and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. To exercise GDPR rights, contact: <a href="mailto:privacy@techbrot.com">privacy@techbrot.com</a>. We may require reasonable verification before fulfilling a request.</p>

    <h4>16. Marketing Communications &amp; Consent</h4>
    <p>We will only send marketing emails if you consented or where we have a legitimate interest and you have not opted out. You may opt out of marketing emails by using the unsubscribe link in emails or by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@techbrot.com">privacy@techbrot.com</a>.</p>

    <h4>17. Sales, Sharing &amp; “Do Not Sell”</h4>
    <p>We do not knowingly sell personal information for profit. If our practices change and we engage in "sale" or "sharing" as defined under CCPA/CPRA, we will provide an easy, conspicuous mechanism to opt out (for example, a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link on the Site).</p>

    <h4>18. Law Enforcement, Legal Requests, and Mergers</h4>
    <p>We may disclose personal information to comply with legal obligations, protect our rights, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets (we will notify users where required by law).</p>

    <h4>19. International, Sectoral &amp; Emerging Laws</h4>
    <p>Privacy law is evolving worldwide. We monitor legal developments (GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, ePrivacy, emerging Indian data law updates) and update this policy as required. Combining GDPR and CCPA disclosures into one policy is common and permitted so long as the policy contains the specific, required disclosures for each law — but many companies keep a separate California notice and an EU/GDPR notice for clarity and easier compliance.</p>

    <h4>20. Changes to This Policy</h4>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy on this page and update the "Last updated" date. When changes are material, we will provide a more prominent notice (e.g., email to users).</p>

    <h4>21. Contact Us / How to Exercise Rights</h4>
    <p>Questions, concerns, or requests to exercise privacy rights may be sent to: <br /><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@techbrot.com">privacy@techbrot.com</a><br /><strong>Phone:</strong> (850) 842-6767<br /><strong>Address:</strong> 651 N Broad St, Suite 201, Middletown, DE 19709</p>

    <h4>22. Disclaimers &amp; Governing Law</h4>
    <p>This policy is for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice. The policy and TechBrot’s privacy practices are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A. Any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Delaware courts. Consult local counsel for jurisdictional questions and binding legal advice.</p>
